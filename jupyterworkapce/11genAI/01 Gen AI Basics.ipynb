In 1609, Henry Hudson, seeking an alternate route to East Asia, anchored his small vessel Halve Maen (English: Half Moon) at Sandy Hook, Harsimus Cove and Weehawken Cove, and elsewhere along what was later named the North River. After spending nine days surveying the area and meeting its inhabitants, he sailed as far north as Albany. The contemporary flag of the city is a variation on the Prince\\'s Flag from the Netherlands. The stripes are blue, white and yellow, with the center of the flag showing the city seal, depicting Hudson\\'s ship, the Half Moon, and other modern vessels.\\nBy 1621, the Dutch West India Company was organized to manage this new territory and in June 1623, New Netherland became a Dutch province, with headquarters in New Amsterdam. Michael Reyniersz Pauw received a land grant as patroon on the condition that he would establish a settlement of not fewer than fifty persons within four years. He chose the west bank of the Hudson River and purchased the land from the Lenape. This grant is dated November 22, 1630, and is the earliest known conveyance for what are now Hoboken and Jersey City. Pauw, however, was an absentee landlord who neglected to populate the area and was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. That year, a house was built at Communipaw for Jan Evertsen Bout, superintendent of the colony, which had been named Pavonia (the Latinized form of Pauw\\'s name, which means \"peacock\"). Shortly after, another house was built at Harsimus Cove and became the home of Cornelius Van Vorst, who had succeeded Bout as superintendent, and whose family would become influential in the development of the city. Relations with the Lenape deteriorated, in part because of the colonialist\\'s mismanagement and misunderstanding of the indigenous people, and led to series of raids and reprisals and the virtual destruction of the settlement on the west bank. During Kieft\\'s War, approximately eighty Lenapes were killed by the Dutch in a massacre at Pavonia on the night of February 25, 1643.\\nScattered communities of farmsteads characterized the Dutch settlements at Pavonia: Communipaw, Harsimus, Paulus Hook, Hoebuck, Awiehaken, Pamrapo, and other lands \"behind Kill van Kull\".

Thompson. The new team was officially named the Scouts in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue of the same name which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park. In the team's inaugural season, 1974–75, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL. Kansas City fell to 36 points the following season, and had a 27-game win-less streak, three short of the NHL record, which was set when the 1980–81 Winnipeg Jets went 30 games without a win. The Scouts had difficulty drawing fans to home games, and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) leader Alan Eagleson publicly expressed concerns about whether Scouts players would be paid.\\nAfter two seasons in Kansas City, the franchise moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado \"),\n",

It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas. On October 31, 1693, it was organized as a New Jersey township based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a royal charter on April 27, 1713. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by the New Jersey Legislature\\'s Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey\\'s initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark\\'s Vailsburg.\\nThe name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent, England, because of the influence of the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire. But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named \"New Ark\" for \"New Ark of the Covenant\" and some of the colonists saw it as \"New-Work\", the settlers\\' new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name \"New Ark\" are found in preserved letters w'),\n",

New Jersey\\'s first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey\\'s initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in New Jersey is Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey\\'s county names derive from several sources, though most of its counties are named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the colonial and revolutionary periods.

In the wake of the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The court ruled unanimously that the existing system was unconstitutional, ordered that interim measures be established by statute for the 1965 legislative elections, and ordered that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with \"one man, one vote\" requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The senate unilaterally—by internal rule, not by statute—enacted a proposal whereby each senator\\'s vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented,  under which Cape May County\\'s senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1 votes, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it was unconstitutional for the senate to adopt a weighted voting system unilaterally. In 1966, the constitution was amended to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assembly members, without relation to county boundaries.\\n\\n\\n== FIPS code ==\\n\\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry.

The first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was called Prigmore's Swamp (1681–1697), then known as Inian's Ferry (1691–1714). In 1714, the settlement was given the name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (Brunswick in Low German), in the state of Lower Saxony, now located in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League and was an administrative seat for the Duchy of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\\n\\n\\n=== Colonial and Early American periods ===\\nCentrally located between New York City and Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the King's Highway and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders.

Paterson has the nation\\'s second-largest per capita Muslim population.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe area of Paterson was inhabited by the Algonquian-speaking Native American Acquackanonk tribe of the Lenape, also known as the Delaware Indians. The land was known as the Lenapehoking. The Dutch claimed the land as New Netherlands, followed by the British as the Province of New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n=== Establishment ===\\nIn 1791, Alexander Hamilton (1755/57–1804), first United States Secretary of the Treasury,  helped found the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), which helped encourage the harnessing of energy from the Great Falls of the Passaic River to secure economic independence from British manufacturers. The society founded Paterson, which became the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. Paterson was named for William Paterson, statesman, signer of the Constitution and Governor of New Jersey, who signed the 1792 charter that established the Town of Paterson.\\nArchitect, engineer, and city planner Pierre L\\'Enfant (1754–1825), who had earlier developed the initial plans for Washington, D.C., was the first planner for the S.U.M. project. His plan proposed to harness the power of the Great Falls through a channel in the rock and an aqueduct. The society\\'s directors felt he was taking too long and was over budget, and he was replaced by Peter Colt, who used a less complicated reservoir system to get the water flowing to factories in 1794. Eventually, Colt\\'s system developed some problems and a scheme resembling L\\'Enfant\\'s original plan was used after 1846.\\nPaterson was originally formed as a township from portions of Acquackanonk Township on April 11, 1831, while the area was still part of Essex County. It became part of the newly created Passaic County on February 7, 1837, and was incorporated as a city on April 14, 1851, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The city was reincorporated on March 14, 1861.\\n\\n\\n=== Industrial growth ===\\nThe 77-foot-high (23 m) Great Falls and a system of water raceways that harnessed the falls\\' power provided power for the mills in the area until 1914 and fostered growth of the city. The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and, later, the firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 19th century, silk production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of Paterson\\'s most prosperous period, earning it the nickname \"Silk City.\"\\nIn 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in Paterson, but within a few years he moved his business to Hartford, Connecticut. Later in the 19th century, Paterson was the site of early experiments with submarines by Irish-American inventor John Philip Holland. Two of Holland\\'s early models—one found at the bottom of the Passaic River—are on display in the Paterson Museum, housed in the former Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works near the Passaic Falls.\\nBehind Newark and New York, the brewing industry was booming in Paterson in'),\n",

The original boundaries of the province were slightly larger than the current state, extending into a part of the present state of New York, until the border was finalized in 1773.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThe Province of New Jersey was originally settled in the 1610s as part of the colony of New Netherland. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam in September 1664 gave control over the entire Mid-Atlantic region to the English as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The English justified the seizure by claiming that John Cabot, an Italian under the sponsorship of the English King Henry VII, had been the first to discover the place, but it was probably to assert control over the profitable North Atlantic trade. Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant, unable to rouse a military defense, relinquished control of the colony and was able in the articles of transfer to secure guarantees for property rights, laws of inheritance, and freedom of religion. After the surrender, Richard Nicolls took the position as deputy-governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland, including those settlements on the west side of the North River (Hudson River) known as Bergen and those along the Delaware River that had been New Sweden.\\n\\n\\n== Proprietary government ==\\n\\nIn March 1664, King Charles II granted his brother, James, the Duke of York, a Royal colony that covered New Netherlands and present-day Maine. This charter also included parts of present-day Massachusetts, which conflicted with that colony's charter. The charter allowed James traditional propriety rights and imposed few restrictions upon his powers. In general terms, the charter was equivalent to a conveyance of land conferring on him the right of possession, control, and government, subject only to the limitation that the government must be consistent with the laws of England. The Duke of York never visited his colony and exercised little direct control of it. He elected to administer his government through governors, councils, and other officers appointed by himself. No provision was made for an elected assembly.\\n\\nLater in 1664, the Duke of York gave the part of his new possessions between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the island of Jersey, Carteret's ancestral home. The other section of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English lords proprietors of New Jersey. The two proprietors of New Jersey attempted to attract more settlers to move to the province by granting sections of lands to settlers and by passing the Concession and Agreement, a 1665 document that granted religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; under the British government, there was no such religious freedom as the Church of England was the state church. In return for the land, the settlers were supposed to pay annual fees known as quit-rents.\\nIn 1665, Philip Carteret became the first governor of New Jersey, appointed by the two proprietors. He selected Elizabeth as the capital of New Jersey. Immediately, Carteret issued several additional grants of land to landowners. Towns were started and charters granted to Newark (1666), Piscataway (1666), Bergen (1668), Middletown (1693), Woodbridge (1669), and Shrewsbury.\\nThe i\"),\n",

The town was not named for Queen Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of New Jersey. She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital of New Jersey.\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Elizabethtown was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and Staten Island, culminating in the Battle of Springfield which decisively defeated British attempts to gain New Jersey. After independence, it was from Elizabethtown that George Washington embarked by boat to Manhattan for his 1789 inauguration. There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in Elizabeth.\\nOn March 13, 1855, the City of Elizabeth was created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, combining and replacing both Elizabeth Borough (which dated back to 1740) and Elizabeth Township (which had been formed in 1693), subject to the results of a referendum held on March 27, 1855. On March 19, 1857, the city became part of the newly created Union County. Portions of the city were taken to form Linden Township on March 4, 1861.\\nThe first major industry, the Singer Sewing Machine Company came to Elizabeth and employed as many as 2,000 people. In 1895, it saw one of the first car companies, when Electric Carriage and Wagon Company was founded to manufacture the Electrobat, joined soon by another electric car builder, Andrew L. Riker. The Electric Boat Company got its start building submarines for the United States Navy in Elizabeth, beginning with the launch of USS Holland (SS-1) in 1897. These pioneering naval craft (known as A-Class) were developed at Lewis Nixon\\'s Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth between the years 1896–1903. Elizabeth grew in parallel to its sister city of Newark for many years, but has been more successful in retaining a middle-class presence and was mostly spared riots in the 1960s.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 13.66 square miles (35.37 km2), including 12.32 square miles (31.91 km2) of land and 1.34 square miles (3.46 km2) of water (9.78%).\\nElizabeth is bordered to the southwest by Linden, to the west by Roselle and Roselle Park, to the northwest by Union and Hillside, to the north by Newark (in Essex County). To the east the city is across Newark Bay from Bayonne in Hudson County and the Arthur Kill from Staten Island, New York.\\nThe borders of Elizabeth, Bayonne, and Staten Island meet at one point on Shooters Island, of which 7.5 acres (3.0 ha) of the island is owned by Elizabeth, though the island is managed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\\nThe Elizabeth River is a waterway that courses through the city for 4.2 miles (6.8 km) and is largely channelized, before draining into the Arthur Kill.\\n\\n\\n== Districts and neighborhoods ==\\n\\n\\n=== Midtown / Uptown ===\\n\\nMidtown, also occasionally known as Uptown, is the main commercial district and a historic section as well.

In 1633, David Pietersen De Vries, a Dutch commander, was sailing up the Delaware River when he came across Natives in control of the fort. The settlers that had been left at the fort had decided to return to New Amsterdam (Today Manhattan, New York). Wouter van Twiller, Governor of New Netherland, restored Fort Nassau. He was accused of extravagant spending in the fort\\'s reconstruction. The settlement subsequently sparked competition from European Settlers over control of the fur trade in the area.  The fort was used by the Dutch until around 1650 or 1651 when it was decided that it was far to up the river to be of any value. The buildings and stockades were demolished and Wouter van Twiller assigned Arent Corssen to find a place for another fort. \\nThe British first had a pressence in the area in 1634. On June 21, 1634, Sir Edmund Ployden was given a charter from King Charles I of England for all territory that lies between New England and Maryland. After the Restoration in 1660, previous claims were largely overwritten, the land around Camden was then controlled by different nobles serving under King Charles II that those associated with Sir Edmund Ployden. \\nIn 1664, the Duke of York had the King Charles II create the new colony for Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret.

However, there is no empirical evidence for this notion. Whitcomb gives more credence to the idea that Erastus Randall, E.C. Bramhall and B.F.

Significant civil unrest arose during the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915–1916, in which mostly Polish-American workers staged labor actions against Standard Oil of New Jersey and Tidewater Petroleum, seeking improved pay and working conditions. Four striking workers were killed when strikebreakers, allegedly protected by police, fired upon a violent crowd.\\nThe Cape Liberty Cruise Port is a cruise ship terminal that is on a 430-acre (170 ha) site that had been originally developed for industrial uses in the 1930s and then taken over by the U.S. government during World War II as the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne.

New Jersey Transit, the chief operator of intrastate public transportation, manages three separate light rail systems, eleven commuter rail lines, and a statewide bus system. The Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) links transportation hubs in Manhattan and northeastern New Jersey, while the PATCO Speedline connects downtown Philadelphia to Camden County, New Jersey. Intercity rail is operated by Amtrak along the Northeast Corridor between the major population centers of the Northeastern United States. In addition, New Jersey is home to Newark Liberty International Airport, the nation\\'s fifth-busiest international gateway, and the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal, the principal container ship facility of the New York metropolitan area.\\n\\n\\n== Roadways ==\\n\\nNew Jersey has 38,131 miles (61,366 km) of roads managed by state, county, and municipal governments and toll road authorities. The major roadways fall under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), which operates the state highway system. State-owned highways and toll roads consist of 7% of road mileage and 66% of traffic volume. In contrast, county and municipal roads consist of 93% of road mileage and 34% of traffic volume.\\n\\nNew Jersey, along with Oregon, is one of only two states which prohibit customers from pumping gasoline at gas stations. (However, Oregon has recently changed the law, allowing self-service at night time in rural areas.) As a result, all gas stations are either full service or minimum service.\\n\\n\\n=== Distinctive features ===\\n\\n\\n==== Jughandles ====\\nAccording to the NJDOT, a jughandle is an \"at-grade ramp\" provided at or between intersections to permit motorists to make indirect left turns and/or U-turns. This design utilizes a setup that requires a motorist to use a ramp off the right lane of the main road in advance of the intersection or beyond the intersection. The NJDOT defines three types of jughandles in its design manual. \"Type A\" is the standard forward jughandle that intersects with a cross street. With forward ramps, all turning traffic (right and left) exit onto a jughandle ramp to the right. \"Type B\" is a variant with no cross-street intersected by the jughandle; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street, and is only used at a \"T\" intersection or a U-turn. \"Type C\" is the standard reverse jughandle; left-turning vehicles pass through the intersection and enter a ramp that loops roughly 270 degrees. Jughandles can cause motorist confusion because turning setups are inconsistent among intersections, and such an alignment is unfamiliar to motorists outside of the northeastern United States.\\n\\n\\n==== Traffic circles ====\\n\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, traffic circles were built throughout the state because they were viewed as an efficient way to move traffic through three or more intersecting roads. As suburban and rural populations grew, the traffic circles became outdated because increased vehicle speed and traffic volume caused them to be more dangerous. Many traffic circles became notorious for having frequent accidents and being confusing, especially for non'),\n",

The original charter established the college under the corporate name the trustees of Queen\\'s College, in New-Jersey, named in honor of Queen Charlotte (1744–1818), and created both the college and the Queen\\'s College Grammar School, intended to be a preparatory school affiliated and governed by the college. The Grammar School, today the private Rutgers Preparatory School, was a part of the college community until 1959. New Brunswick was chosen as the location over Hackensack because the New Brunswick Dutch had the support of the Anglican population, making the royal charter easier to obtain.\\n\\nThe original purpose of Queen\\'s College was to \"educate the youth in language, liberal, the divinity, and useful arts and sciences\" and for the training of future ministers for the Dutch Reformed Church.\\nIn 1771, the college admitted its first students, which included a single sophomore and a handful of first-year students taught by a lone instructor, and granted its first degree in 1774, to Matthew Leydt. Despite the religious nature of the early college, the first classes were held at a tavern called the Sign of the Red Lion.

The lawsuit is on-hold, pending a federal investigation.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Initiation and construction ===\\nThe Akshardham campus was initiated by BAPS\\' fifth spiritual leader, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, in 1984. His vision was to create a place of worship in North America for followers that could also enable visitors of different backgrounds to experience Hindu spirituality, architecture, and peace. The land was purchased in 2008. On October 6, 2011, Pramukh Swami Maharaj performed the rituals sanctifying the foundation stones (shilanyas pujan) in Mumbai. \\nOn 15 August 2014, during his final visit to the United States, following the inauguration of the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan mandir in Robbinsville, (the shikharbaddha mandir on the Akshardham campus), Pramukh Swami Maharaj performed the groundbreaking rituals to the areas where the deities would be installed in the Akshardham mandir. Construction of the Akshardham mandir began in 2015. The first marble pillar installation ceremony took place on September 4, 2017, in the presence of Mahant Swami Maharaj, the sixth spiritual leader of BAPS.\\nIn the summer of 2020, the mandovar (the main outer wall of the mandir) was completed. The keystones of each of the four domes, which locks a dome in place, were installed on June 14, 2022. The base of the outer wall, or the jagati peeth, was completed in July 2022. On May 31, 2023, the final stone of the Akshardham mandir was installed.\\nAbout 75% of the Akshardham campus is designed, constructed, managed, and maintained by swamis and volunteers. Between 2011 and 2023, over 12,500 people volunteered to build the mandir. Volunteers carved and installed about 2,000,000 cubic feet (57,000 m3) of stone. The volunteers came from various backgrounds which included students, business executives, physicians, and architects. Volunteers who did not have prior stone mandir construction experience received training on mandir architecture and construction by experts.\\n\\n\\n=== Inauguration ===\\n\\nFrom July 2023, BAPS hosted a three-month-long celebration called the \"Festival of Inspirations\" leading up to its inauguration. During the celebrations, BAPS launched various community programs, including a 10-week-long blood drive and the Days of Giving campaign. The 10-week blood drive had over 4,470 donors and was recognized as one of the longest-running blood drives in the state. T')]"
