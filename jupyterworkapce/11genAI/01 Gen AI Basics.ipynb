      "I. Prologue[a]Chapter 11 In the beginning[b] was the Word,    and the Word was with God,    and the Word was God.(A)2 He was in the beginning with God.3 [c]All things came to be through him,    and without him nothing came to be.(B)What came to be  4 through him was life,    and this life was the light of the human race;(C)5 [d]the light shines in the darkness,(D)    and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 [e]A man named John was sent from God.(E)  7 He came for testimony,[f] to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.(F)  8 He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.(G)  9 The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.(H) 10 He was in the world,    and the world came to be through him,    but the world did not know him.11 He came to what was his own,    but his own people[g] did not accept him. 12 (I)But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,  13 [h](J)who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh[i]    and made his dwelling among us,    and we saw his glory,    the glory as of the Father’s only Son,    full of grace and truth.(K) 15 [j]John testified to him and cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said,(L) ‘The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’”  16 From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace,[k]  17 because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.(M)  18 No one has ever seen God. The only Son, God,[l] who is at the Father’s side, has revealed him.(N) II. The Book of SignsJohn the Baptist’s Testimony to Himself. 19 [m]And this is the testimony of John. When the Jews[n] from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites [to him] to ask him, “Who are you?”  20 [o]he admitted and did not deny it, but admitted,(O) “I am not the Messiah.”  21 So they asked him, “What are you then? Are you Elijah?”[p] And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”(P)  22 So they said to him, “Who are you, so we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you have to say for yourself?”  23 He said:“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the desert,(Q)“Make straight the way of the Lord,”’[q]as Isaiah the prophet said.”  24 Some Pharisees[r] were also sent.  25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?”(R)  26 John answered them, “I baptize with water;[s] but there is one among you whom you do not recognize,(S)  27 the one who is coming after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.”  28 This happened in Bethany across the Jordan,[t] where John was baptizing. John the Baptist’s Testimony to Jesus. 29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God,[u] who takes away the sin of the world.(T)  30 [v]He is the one of whom I said,(U) ‘A man is coming after me who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’  31 I did not know him,[w] but the reason why I came baptizing with water was that he might be made known to Israel.”  32 John testified further, saying, “I saw the Spirit come down like a dove[x] from the sky and remain upon him.  33 I did not know him,(V) but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.’(W)  34 [y](X)Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God.”The First Disciples.(Y)  35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples,  36 and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God.”[z]  37 The two disciples[aa] heard what he said and followed Jesus.  38 Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?”  39 He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four in the afternoon.[ab]  40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.  41 He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah”[ac] (which is translated Anointed).(Z)  42 Then he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John;[ad] you will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).(AA) 43 The next day he[ae] decided to go to Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me.”  44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.  45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the law, and also the prophets, Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”(AB)  46 But Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”  47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Here is a true Israelite.[af] There is no duplicity in him.”  48 [ag](AC)Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”  49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God;[ah] you are the King of Israel.”(AD)  50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree?[ai] You will see greater things than this.”  51 And he said to him, “Amen, amen,[aj] I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”(AE) \n",
      "Footnotes1:1–18 The prologue states the main themes of the gospel: life, light, truth, the world, testimony, and the preexistence of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Logos, who reveals God the Father. In origin, it was probably an early Christian hymn. Its closest parallel is in other christological hymns, Col 1:15–20 and Phil 2:6–11. Its core (Jn 1:1–5, 10–11, 14) is poetic in structure, with short phrases linked by “staircase parallelism,” in which the last word of one phrase becomes the first word of the next. Prose inserts (at least Jn 1:6–8, 15) deal with John the Baptist.\n",
      "1:1 In the beginning: also the first words of the Old Testament (Gn 1:1). Was: this verb is used three times with different meanings in this verse: existence, relationship, and predication. The Word (Greek logos): this term combines God’s dynamic, creative word (Genesis), personified preexistent Wisdom as the instrument of God’s creative activity (Proverbs), and the ultimate intelligibility of reality (Hellenistic philosophy). With God: the Greek preposition here connotes communication with another. Was God: lack of a definite article with “God” in Greek signifies predication rather than identification.\n",
      "1:3 What came to be: while the oldest manuscripts have no punctuation here, the corrector of Bodmer Papyrus P75, some manuscripts, and the Ante-Nicene Fathers take this phrase with what follows, as staircase parallelism. Connection with Jn 1:3 reflects fourth-century anti-Arianism.\n",
      "1:5 The ethical dualism of light and darkness is paralleled in intertestamental literature and in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Overcome: “comprehend” is another possible translation, but cf. Jn 12:35; Wis 7:29–30.\n",
      "1:6 John was sent just as Jesus was “sent” (Jn 4:34) in divine mission. Other references to John the Baptist in this gospel emphasize the differences between them and John’s subordinate role.\n",
      "1:7 Testimony: the testimony theme of John is introduced, which portrays Jesus as if on trial throughout his ministry. All testify to Jesus: John the Baptist, the Samaritan woman, scripture, his works, the crowds, the Spirit, and his disciples.\n",
      "1:11 What was his own…his own people: first a neuter, literally, “his own property/possession” (probably = Israel), then a masculine, “his own people” (the Israelites).\n",
      "1:13 Believers in Jesus become children of God not through any of the three natural causes mentioned but through God who is the immediate cause of the new spiritual life. Were born: the Greek verb can mean “begotten” (by a male) or “born” (from a female or of parents). The variant “he who was begotten,” asserting Jesus’ virginal conception, is weakly attested in Old Latin and Syriac versions.\n",
      "1:14 Flesh: the whole person, used probably against docetic tendencies (cf. 1 Jn 4:2; 2 Jn 7). Made his dwelling: literally, “pitched his tent/tabernacle.” Cf. the tabernacle or tent of meeting that was the place of God’s presence among his people (Ex 25:8–9). The incarnate Word is the new mode of God’s presence among his people. The Greek verb has the same consonants as the Aramaic word for God’s presence (Shekinah). Glory: God’s visible manifestation of majesty in power, which once filled the tabernacle (Ex 40:34) and the temple (1 Kgs 8:10–11, 27), is now centered in Jesus. Only Son: Greek, monogenēs, but see note on Jn 1:18. Grace and truth: these words may represent two Old Testament terms describing Yahweh in covenant relationship with Israel (cf. Ex 34:6), thus God’s “love” and “fidelity.” The Word shares Yahweh’s covenant qualities.\n",
      "1:15 This verse, interrupting Jn 1:14, 16 seems drawn from Jn 1:30.\n",
      "1:16 Grace in place of grace: replacement of the Old Covenant with the New (cf. Jn 1:17). Other possible translations are “grace upon grace” (accumulation) and “grace for grace” (correspondence).\n",
      "1:18 The only Son, God: while the vast majority of later textual witnesses have another reading, “the Son, the only one” or “the only Son,” the translation above follows the best and earliest manuscripts, monogenēs theos, but takes the first term to mean not just “Only One” but to include a filial relationship with the Father, as at Lk 9:38 (“only child”) or Hb 11:17 (“only son”) and as translated at Jn 1:14. The Logos is thus “only Son” and God but not Father/God.\n",
      "1:19–51 The testimony of John the Baptist about the Messiah and Jesus’ self-revelation to the first disciples. This section constitutes the introduction to the gospel proper and is connected with the prose inserts in the prologue. It develops the major theme of testimony in four scenes: John’s negative testimony about himself; his positive testimony about Jesus; the revelation of Jesus to Andrew and Peter; the revelation of Jesus to Philip and Nathanael.\n",
      "1:19 The Jews: throughout most of the gospel, the “Jews” does not refer to the Jewish people as such but to the hostile authorities, both Pharisees and Sadducees, particularly in Jerusalem, who refuse to believe in Jesus. The usage reflects the atmosphere, at the end of the first century, of polemics between church and synagogue, or possibly it refers to Jews as representative of a hostile world (Jn 1:10–11).\n",
      "1:20 Messiah: the anointed agent of Yahweh, usually considered to be of Davidic descent. See further the note on Jn 1:41.\n",
      "1:21 Elijah: the Baptist did not claim to be Elijah returned to earth (cf. Mal 3:19; Mt 11:14). The Prophet: probably the prophet like Moses (Dt 18:15; cf. Acts 3:22).\n",
      "1:23 This is a repunctuation and reinterpretation (as in the synoptic gospels and Septuagint) of the Hebrew text of Is 40:3 which reads, “A voice cries out: In the desert prepare the way of the Lord.”\n",
      "1:24 Some Pharisees: other translations, such as “Now they had been sent from the Pharisees,” misunderstand the grammatical construction. This is a different group from that in Jn 1:19; the priests and Levites would have been Sadducees, not Pharisees.\n",
      "1:26 I baptize with water: the synoptics add “but he will baptize you with the holy Spirit” (Mk 1:8) or “…holy Spirit and fire” (Mt 3:11; Lk 3:16). John’s emphasis is on purification and preparation for a better baptism.\n",
      "1:28 Bethany across the Jordan: site unknown. Another reading is “Bethabara.”\n",
      "1:29 The Lamb of God: the background for this title may be the victorious apocalyptic lamb who would destroy evil in the world (Rev 5–7; 17:14); the paschal lamb, whose blood saved Israel (Ex 12); and/or the suffering servant led like a lamb to the slaughter as a sin-offering (Is 53:7, 10).\n",
      "1:30 He existed before me: possibly as Elijah (to come, Jn 1:27); for the evangelist and his audience, Jesus’ preexistence would be implied (see note on Jn 1:1).\n",
      "1:31 I did not know him: this gospel shows no knowledge of the tradition (Lk 1) about the kinship of Jesus and John the Baptist. The reason why I came baptizing with water: in this gospel, John’s baptism is not connected with forgiveness of sins; its purpose is revelatory, that Jesus may be made known to Israel.\n",
      "1:32 Like a dove: a symbol of the new creation (Gn 8:8) or the community of Israel (Hos 11:11). Remain: the first use of a favorite verb in John, emphasizing the permanency of the relationship between Father and Son (as here) and between the Son and the Christian. Jesus is the permanent bearer of the Spirit.\n",
      "1:34 The Son of God: this reading is supported by good Greek manuscripts, including the Chester Beatty and Bodmer Papyri and the Vatican Codex, but is suspect because it harmonizes this passage with the synoptic version: “This is my beloved Son” (Mt 3:17; Mk 1:11; Lk 3:22). The poorly attested alternate reading, “God’s chosen One,” is probably a reference to the Servant of Yahweh (Is 42:1).\n",
      "1:36 John the Baptist’s testimony makes his disciples’ following of Jesus plausible.\n",
      "1:37 The two disciples: Andrew (Jn 1:40) and, traditionally, John, son of Zebedee (see note on Jn 13:23).\n",
      "1:39 Four in the afternoon: literally, the tenth hour, from sunrise, in the Roman calculation of time. Some suggest that the next day, beginning at sunset, was the sabbath; they would have stayed with Jesus to avoid travel on it.\n",
      "1:41 Messiah: the Hebrew word māšîaḥ, “anointed one” (see note on Lk 2:11), appears in Greek as the transliterated messias only here and in Jn 4:25. Elsewhere the Greek translation christos is used.\n",
      "1:42 Simon, the son of John: in Mt 16:17, Simon is called Bariōna, “son of Jonah,” a different tradition for the name of Simon’s father. Cephas: in Aramaic = the Rock; cf. Mt 16:18. Neither the Greek equivalent Petros nor, with one isolated exception, Cephas is attested as a personal name before Christian times.\n",
      "1:43 He: grammatically, could be Peter, but logically is probably Jesus.\n",
      "1:47 A true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him: Jacob was the first to bear the name “Israel” (Gn 32:29), but Jacob was a man of duplicity (Gn 27:35–36).\n",
      "1:48 Under the fig tree: a symbol of messianic peace (cf. Mi 4:4; Zec 3:10).\n",
      "1:49 Son of God: this title is used in the Old Testament, among other ways, as a title of adoption for the Davidic king (2 Sm 7:14; Ps 2:7; 89:27), and thus here, with King of Israel, in a messianic sense. For the evangelist, Son of God also points to Jesus’ divinity (cf. Jn 20:28).\n",
      "1:50 Possibly a statement: “You [singular] believe because I saw you under the fig tree.”\n",
      "1:51 The double “Amen” is characteristic of John. You is plural in Greek. The allusion is to Jacob’s ladder (Gn 28:12).\n",

John 21:22 references a disciple whom Jesus loved and John 21:24–25 says: \"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true\". Early Christian tradition, first found in Irenaeus (c.\\u2009130 – c.\\u2009202 AD), identified this disciple with John the Apostle, but most scholars have abandoned this hypothesis or hold it only tenuously; there are multiple reasons for this conclusion, including, for example, the fact that the gospel is written in good Greek and displays sophisticated theology, and is therefore unlikely to have been the work of a simple fisherman. Rather, these verses imply that the core of the gospel relies on the testimony (perhaps written) of the \"disciple who is testifying\", as collected, preserved, and reshaped by a community of followers (the \"we\" of the passage), and that a single follower (the \"I\") rearranged this material and perhaps added the final chapter and other passages to produce the final gospel. Most scholars estimate the final form of the text to be around AD 90–110. Given its complex history there may have been more than one place of composition, and while the author was familiar with Jewish customs and traditions, their frequent clarification of these implies that they wrote for a mixed Jewish/Gentile or Jewish context outside Palestine.\\nThe author may have drawn on a \"signs source\" (a collection of miracles) for chapters 1–12, a \"passion source\" for the story of Jesus\\'s arrest and crucifixion, and a \"sayings source\" for the discourses, but these hypotheses are much debated. The author seems to have known some version of Mark and Luke, as John shares with them some vocabulary and clusters of incidents arranged in the same order, but key terms from those gospels are absent or nearly so, implying that if the author did know them they felt free to write independently. The Hebrew scriptures were an important source, with 14 direct quotations (versus 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke), and their influence is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included, but the majority of John\\'s direct quotations do not agree exactly with any known version of the Jewish scriptures. Recent arguments by Richard Bauckham and others that John preserves eyewitness testimony have not won general acceptance.\\n\\n\\n=== Setting: the Johannine community debate ===\\nFor much of the 20th century, scholars interpreted the Gospel of John within the paradigm of a hypothetical \"Johannine community\", meaning that it was held to have sprung from a late-1st-century Christian community excommunicated from the Jewish synagogue (probably meaning the Jewish communit'),\n",

It was first published in a photographic edition in 1956. This was followed three years later (1959) by the first English-language translation, with Coptic transcription. In 1977, James M.

Debates surrounding various positions partly revolve around how antisemitism is defined, and on scholarly disagreements over whether antisemitism has a monolithic continuous history or is instead an umbrella term covering many distinct kinds of hostility to Jews over history.\\nFactional agendas underpin the writing of the canonical texts, and the various New Testament documents are windows into the conflict and debates of that period. According to Timothy Johnson, mutual slandering among competing sects was quite strong in the period when these works were composed. The New Testament moreover is an ensemble of texts written over decades and \"it is quite meaningless to speak about a single New Testament attitude\".\\n\\n\\n== The New Testament and Christian antisemitism ==\\n\\nAccording to Rabbi Michael J. Cook, Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College, there are ten themes in the New Testament that have been sources of anti-Judaism and antisemitism:\\n\\nThe Jews are culpable for crucifying Jesus – as such they are guilty of deicide.\\nThe tribulations of the Jewish people throughout history constitute God\\'s punishment of them for killing Jesus.\\nJesus originally came to preach only to the Jews, but when they rejected him, he abandoned them for gentiles instead.\\nThe Children of Israel were God\\'s original chosen people by virtue of an ancient covenant, but by rejecting Jesus they forfeited their chosenness - and now, by virtue of a New Covenant (or \"testament\"), Christians have replaced the Jews as God\\'s chosen people, the Church having become the \"People of God.\"\\nThe Jewish Bible (\"Old\" Testament) repeatedly portrays the opaqueness and stubbornness of the Jewish people and their disloyalty to God.\\nThe Jewish Bible contains many predictions of the coming of Jesus as the Messiah (or \"Christ\"), yet the Jews are blind to the meaning of their own Bible.\\nBy the time of Jesus\\' ministry, Judaism had ceased to be a living faith.\\nJudaism\\'s essence is a restrictive and burdensome legalism.\\nChristianity emphasizes love, while Judaism stands for justice and a God of wrath.\\nJudaism\\'s oppressiveness reflects the disposition of Jesus\\' opponents called \"Pharisees\" (predecessors of the \"rabbis\"), who in their teachings and behavior were hypocrites (see Woes of the Pharisees).\\nCook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among gentiles loyal to the Roman Empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.\\nSome scholars say that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people. Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of Antisemitism in the New Testament (University Press of America, 1994) has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College),  and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University).\\n\\n\\n== New Testament ==\\n\\nThere are some verses in the New Testament that describe Jews in a positive way, attributing to them salvation or divine love.\\nAccording to the New '),\n",

All four works contained in the manuscript are written in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic. Two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary have been discovered since, both written in Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus L 3525 and Papyrus Rylands 463). P.Oxy. L 3525 \"... was in fact found by Grenfell and Hunt some time between 1897 and 1906, but only published in 1983,\"\\nby P. J. Parsons.\\nThe two fragments were published in 1938 and 1983 respectively, and the Coptic translation was published in 1955 by Walter Till.\\nDating the gospel, as with most ancient literary texts, is problematic. As the earliest extant fragment of the gospel (the Rylands papyrus) dates to the early Third Century, it must predate this. Karen L. King, Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, suggested that the gospel was composed early in the Second Century, noting that it evidences familiarity with the Gospel of John, and perhaps the letters of Paul, thus likely postdating 190–200 CE. Christopher Tuckett\\'s discussion in his 2007 volume notes Pasquier\\'s preference for a date in the second half of the century; Tuckett himself ultimately opts for a middle position – he places it in the first half of the Second Century but later than King.\\nThe Gospel of Mary is not present in the list of apocryphal books of section five of the Decretum Gelasianum.\\n\\n\\n== The identity of \"Mary\" ==\\nScholars do not always agree which of the New Testament people named Mary is the central character of the Gospel of Mary. Stephen J. Shoemaker and F. Stanley Jones have suggested that she may be Mary the mother of Jesus. Barbara J. Silvertsen alternatively suggests that she may be a sister of Jesus - an individual who has largely been lost in history.  Silvertsen says that while none of the canonical Gospels identifies Jesus\\'s sisters by name (Mark 6:3, Matthew 13:56), one of his sisters is identified as \"Mary\" in the Gospel of Philip. \\nArguments in favor of Mary Magdalene are based on her status as a known follower of Jesus, her appearance in other early Christian writings. She is mentioned as accompanying Jesus on his journeys (Luke 8:2) and is listed in the Gospel of Matthew as being present at his crucifixion (Matthew 27:56) and along with the ‘other Mary’ being the first to see the Risen Lord (Matthew 28:9 In the Gospel of John, she is recorded as the sole first witness of Jesus’ resurrection (John 20:14–16); (Mark 16:9 later manuscripts).\\nEsther A. de Boer compares her role in other non-canonical texts, noting that \"in the Gospel of Mary it is Peter who is opposed to Mary’s words, because she is a woman. Peter has the same role in the Gospel of Thomas and in Pistis Sophia. In Pistis Sophia the Mary concerned is identified as Mary Magdalene.\" The final scene in the Gospel of Mary may also provide evidence that Mary is indeed Mary Magdalene. Levi, in his defense of Mary and her teaching, tells Peter, \"Surely the Saviour knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than us.\" In the Gospel of Philip, a similar statement is made about Mary Magdalene.\\nKing also argues in favor of naming Mary Magdalene as the central figure in the Gospel of Mary. She summarizes: “It was precisely the traditions of Mary as a woman, as an exemplary disciple, a witness to the ministry of Jesus, a visionary of the glorified Jesus, and someone traditionally in contest with Peter, that made her the only'),\n",

It is usually dated through the eschatological discourse in Mark 13, which scholars interpret as pointing to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–74 AD)—a war that led to the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. This would place the composition of Mark either immediately after the destruction or during the years immediately prior. The dating around 70 AD is not dependent on the naturalistic argument that Jesus could not have made an accurate prophecy; scholars like Michael Barber and Amy-Jill Levine argue the Historical Jesus predicted the destruction of the Temple.  The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as the conflict stories which appear in Mark 2:1-3:6, apocalyptic discourse such as Mark 13:1–37, miracle stories, parables, a passion narrative, and collections of sayings, although not the hypothesized Q source.\\n\\n\\n=== Setting ===\\nThe Gospel of Mark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience, and probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested. Theologian and former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proposed that Libya as a possible setting, as it was the location of Cyrene and there is a long-held Arabic tradition of Mark\\'s residence there.\\nThe consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels are a subset of the ancient genre of bios, or ancient biography. Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject\\'s reputation and memory, and also included morals and rhetoric in their works. Like all the synoptic gospels, the purpose of writing was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, as opposed to serving as a tractate for missionary conversion. Christian churches were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels: one the \"historical\" presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author\\'s own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (\"kingdom of God\") and those of the early church (\"believe\", \"gospel\").\\n\\nChristianity began within Judaism, with a Christian \"church\" (or ἐκκλησία, ekklesia, meaning \\'assembly\\') that arose shortly after Jesus\\'s death when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead.

Nicodemus is never mentioned in the synoptic Gospels, and this is one of four times John mentions him: the others are 2:23–25, where he appeared but was unmentioned; 7:50; and 19:39. The meeting, likely in Jerusalem, is part of the passion of Jesus. Unlike Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Gospel of John is the only one to mention Jesus\\' life not in chronological order.\\nNicodemus was a member of the Pharisees, a Jewish religious movement in Second Temple Judaism. It was known for its strict adherence to the halakha (Jewish law), and for its highly oppositional attitudes of the ministry of Jesus. To avoid trouble with other Pharisees, Nicodemus came to Jesus at night; it is the only time a Pharisee is presented positively in the presence of Jesus. Later, Nicodemus became a follower of Jesus.\\nNicodemus said he knew Jesus was \"a teacher who came from God\". He then added: \"For no-one could perform the miraculous signs he was doing if God were not with him.\" They then discussed the need to be born again before being able to see the Kingdom of God and where the spirit goes after the death of the body. Jesus then spoke about salvation and of the damnation that those who do not believe in him will face. He also criticised Nicodemus for his lack in the understanding of theology.\\n\\n\\n== Translations ==\\nSome of translations for the verse have been provided as below:\\n\\nIt can be seen that:\\n\\nsome translations (e.g., the Mercian) negate the perishing while most (e.g., the West Saxon) negate the everyone;\\nsome translations have \"only\", others have \"only begotten\";\\nLuther and Wright favour \"lost\" over \"perish\".\\n\\n\\n== Analysis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Exegesis ===\\n\\nJohn 3:16 has been termed as \"the golden text of the Bible\", \"the gospel in a nutshell\", and \"everyman\\'s text\". One of the verses pivotal to the Johannine theology, it concerns God\\'s motive for sending Jesus.  In Christianity, it is thought that believing in Jesus grants eternal life to the believer. Eternal life is a dominant theme throughout John\\'s entire Gospel, and its first appearance in the Gospel is in this verse. Theologian Larry Hurtado sees the verse as reflecting Jesus\\' importance in Christianity. The Methodist minister C. K. Barrett wrote, \"Mention of ... the eternal life given ... to believers ... suggests ... the general setting of the work of Christ in the love and judgement of God.\"\\nThe verse (which has parallels with John 3:15 and John 3:17) has been used by some to support Christian universalism, a view that all humans will eventually be saved by God or denies eternal suffering in Hell. However, Anglican bishop N. T. Wright has argued against this, saying that the \"position is quite clear: God in His great love has made one way of salvation for all men without exception. Those who refuse this way have no alternative left to them. And accepting the way of salvation, for John as for Paul, is bound up with faith in Jesus Christ.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Purpose ====\\nTheologians have assumed the verse\\'s purpose to be that of strengthening '),\n",

The author describes it as having occurred after Jesus had \"gone back to the place from which he came\".\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nMany second-century Christians, both Gnostic and orthodox, hoped to receive a transcendent personal revelation such as Paul the Apostle reported to the church at Corinth (2 Corinthians 12:1–4) or that John the Revelator experienced on the isle of Patmos, which inspired the Book of Revelation. As Acts narrates what happened after the time Jesus ascended to heaven, so the Apocryphon of John begins at the same point but relates how Christ reappeared to John.\\nThe opening words of the Secret Book of John are, \"The teaching of the saviour, and the revelation of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence, even these things which he taught John, his disciple.\" The author John is immediately specified as \"John, the brother of James—who are the sons of Zebedee.\" The remainder of the book is a vision of spiritual realms and of the prior history of spiritual humanity.\\nThere are four separate surviving manuscripts of \"The Secret Book of John\".  One was purchased in Egypt in 1896 (the Berlin Codex) and three were found in the Nag Hammadi codices discovered in 1945.  All date to the 4th century and are Coptic translations from Greek. Three appear to have been independently produced. Two of the four are similar enough that they probably were copied from a single source.  \\nAlthough the different versions of the texts have minor variants (the Berlin Codex has many minor differences with Nag Hammadi II and IV), all texts generally agree on the assertion that the main revealing entity was Jesus.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nA book called the Apocryphon of John was referred to by Irenaeus in Adversus Haereses, written about 185, among \"an indescribable number of secret and illegitimate writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish people, who are ignorant of the true scriptures\"—scriptures which Irenaeus himself helped to establish (see the canonical four). Among the writings he quotes from, in order to expose and refute them, are the Gospel of Truth, Gospel of Judas, and this secret book of John. \\nLittle more was known of this text until 1945, when a cache of thirteen papyrus codices (bound books) that had been hidden away in the 4th century, was fortuitously discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt (CG II). The Apocryphon of John was among the texts, in three Coptic versions translated from the Greek. Two of the versions are very similar and represent one manuscript tradition; they incorporate a lengthy excerpt from a certain Book of Zoroaster appended to the Apocryphon (as chapters 15:29 – 19:8f) A shorter version of the Apocryphon found at Nag Hammadi does not contain the interpolation and represents another manuscript tradition. Still another version of this short edition of the text was discovered in an ancient Coptic Codex acquired by Dr. Carl Reinhardt in Cairo in 1896. This manuscript (identified as the \"Berlin Gnostic Codex\" or BG 8502) was used along with the three versions found at Nag Hammadi to produce the translations now available.  The fact that four manuscript \"editions\" of this text survived—two \"long\" versions and two \"short\" versions—suggests how important this text was in early gnostic Christian circles. In the three Nag Hammadi codices the Apocryphon of John appears always in the first version.\\n\\n\\n== Influence ==\\nThe Apocryphon, set in the framing device of a revelation delivered by the resurrected Christ to John the son of Zebedee, contains some of the most extensive detailing of classic dua'),\n",

A Gospel story relates how the brothers wanted to call down heavenly fire on an unhospitable Samaritan town, but Jesus rebuked them.

On 14 July 2011 the British Library launched a fundraising campaign to buy the book for £9 million, and on 17 April 2012 announced that the purchase had been completed and the book was now British Library Add MS 89000.\\nThe library plans to display the Gospel for equal amounts of time in London and Durham. It describes the manuscript as \"the earliest surviving intact European book and one of the world\\'s most significant books\". The Cuthbert Gospel returned to Durham to feature in exhibitions in 2013 and 2014, and was in the British Library\\'s Anglo-Saxon exhibition in 2018/19; it also spends periods \"resting\" off display. A new book on the gospel was published in 2015, incorporating the results of research since the purchase; among other things this pushed the likely date from the late 7th century to between around 700 and 730.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\n\\nThe St Cuthbert Gospel is a pocket-sized book, 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 × 3.6 in), of the Gospel of St John written in uncial script on 94 vellum folios. It is bound in wooden cover boards, covered with tooled red leather.\\n\\n\\n=== Context ===\\nThe St Cuthbert Gospel is significant both intrinsically as the earliest surviving European book complete with its original binding and by association with the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne. A miniature in the Codex Amiatinus, of the Prophet Ezra writing in his library, shows several books similarly bound in red decorated with geometric designs. This miniature was probably based on an original in the Codex Grandior, a lost imported Italian Bible at Jarrow, which showed Cassiodorus and the nine volumes he wrote of commentary on the Bible. Whether the bindings depicted, which were presumably of leather, included raised elements cannot be detected, but the books are stored singly flat in a cupboard, which would reduce the wear on any raised patterns.\\nEarly medieval treasure bindings with a structure in precious metal, and often containing gems, carved ivory panels or metal reliefs, are perhaps better known today than leather bindings, but '),\n",

Polycarp of Smyrna quotes about the \"antichrist\" in his Epistle to the Phillipians 7:1, a sure reference from the letters of John because the antichrist doctrine is not found in the textual record before the Johannine letters. Justin Martyr also alludes to ideas in John, though this reference is not certain, so the dating of John is not settled.\\nThe earliest testimony to the author was that of Papias, preserved in fragmentary quotes in Eusebius\\'s history of the Church. This text is consequently rather obscure. Eusebius says that two different Johns must be distinguished, John the Apostle, and John the Presbyter, with the Gospel assigned to the Apostle and the Book of Revelation to the Presbyter.\\nIrenaeus\\'s witness based on Papias represents the tradition in Ephesus, where John the Apostle is reputed to have lived. Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp, thus in the second generation after the apostle. According to many scholars, he states unequivocally that the apostle is the author of the Gospel. (Other scholars note, however, that Irenaeus consistently refers to the author of the gospel, as well as of Revelation, as \"the disciple of the Lord,\" whereas he refers to the others as \"apostles.\" And so Irenaeus appears to distinguish John, the author of the fourth gospel, from John the Apostle.) Koester rejects the reference of Ignatius of Antioch as referring to the Gospel and cites Irenaeus as the first to use it.\\nFor some time it was common practice to assert that the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which contains a small portion of chapter 18 of the Gospel of John, demonstrated that the text of the gospel spread rapidly through Egypt in the second century. However, more recent scholarship has shown the fragment may date from as late as the third or fourth century, rather than the second century, as was previously supposed.\\nClement of Alexandria mentions John the Apostle\\'s missionary activity in Asia Minor, and continues, \"As for John, the last, upon seeing that in the Gospels they had told the corporal matters, supported by his disciples and inspired by the Holy Spirit, he wrote a spiritual Gospel.\" Origen, when asked how John had placed the cleansing of the Temple first rather than last, responded, \"John does not always tell the truth literally, he always tells the truth spiritually.\" In Alexandria, the authorship of the Gospel and the first epistle was never questioned.

The text contains multiple parts, which are uneven in style and would seem to be by different authors. A prologue found in some versions asserts that the text is a translation into Greek of eyewitness accounts found in the praetorium at Jerusalem. The question of the original language is debated. Beyond Greek, the versions in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Slavonic, and other languages have survived.\\nThe prevailing view is that the Christian Acts of Pilate were first devised and published as a confutation to an earlier pagan and anti-Christian work also known as the Acts of Pilate. It can be shown that the work behind the Christian Acts of Pilate must have originated very early, but the complete work in its existing form dates to no earlier than the 4th or 5th century. Although \"the Acts of Pontius Pilate\" are mentioned by Justin Martyr in his First Apology (c.\\u2009155 AD), this simply refers to unspecified records which Justin assumed must exist. Church historian  Eusebius of Caesarea (writing c.\\u2009325 AD) shows no acquaintance with this Gospel, despite being aware of related texts (such as the \"Letters of Pilate\" referred to by Justin and Tertullian as well as a pagan version of the Acts of Pilate). Epiphanius refers to an Acta Pilati (c.\\u2009376 AD), but the extant Greek texts show evidence of later editing.\\n\\n\\n== Contents ==\\nThe main body of the Gospel of Nicodemus is in two parts. The first part contains the trial of Jesus (chapters i–xi) and an account of the Resurrection (chapters xii–xvi). The narrative of the trial is based upon Luke 23. In addition to the Greek and Latin witnesses of the first part, there are three other notable ancient versions in Syriac, Armenian, and Coptic. The second part (chapters xvii–xxvii) contains the story of the Harrowing of Hell. In it, Leucius and Charinus, two souls raised from the dead after the crucifixion, relate to the Sanhedrin the circumstances of the descent of Christ into Hell, and the deliverance of the righteous Old Testament patriarchs. It also describes the salvation of Saint Dismas, the penitent thief. This section is a later addition to the Acts, but is probably based upon an older document. It appears most often in the Latin manuscripts, and only rarely in Greek.\\nSome Latin manuscripts contain an appended text, the Letter of Pilate to Claudius. This purports to be an official report made by Pontius Pilate to Claudius containing a description of the crucifixion, as well as an account of the resurrection of Jesus. This text is also found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul. One series of Latin manuscripts also includes the episode Cura Sanitatis Tiberii (\"The Cure of Tiberius\"), the oldest form of the legend of Saint Veronica.\\n\\n\\n== Significance ==\\nThe Gospel of Nicodemus has had a long history inspiring devotional works. A Meditatione sopra la Passione del nostro signore Iesu Christo, drawing in part on this gospel for its expanded anecdotal elements in the Passion, was printed 28 times in Italy between about 1476 and 1500, and inspired the depiction of Christ before Pilate by Pontormo.\\nThe Gospel of Nicodemus names several minor New Testament figures who were not named in the canonical texts; for example, the soldier who speared Jesus on the cross is na'),\n",

It has been dated from the late 2nd century, although this dating is disputed. Papyrus 75 (= Papyrus Bodmer XIV–XV) is another very early manuscript (late 2nd/early 3rd century), and it includes an attribution of the Gospel to Luke.\\nThe oldest complete texts are the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, both from the Alexandrian family; Codex Bezae, a 5th- or 6th-century Western text-type manuscript that contains Luke in Greek and Latin versions on facing pages, appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points.\\nCodex Bezae shows comprehensively the differences between the versions which show no core theological significance.\\n\\n\\n=== Luke–Acts: unity, authorship and date ===\\n\\nThe gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author, providing the framework for both the Church\\'s liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of Jesus.\\nThe author is not named in either volume. According to a Church tradition, first attested by Irenaeus (c.\\u2009130 – c.\\u2009202 AD), he was the Luke named as a companion of Paul in three of the Pauline letters, but \"a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.\" An example can be seen by comparing Acts\\' accounts of Paul\\'s conversion (Acts 9:1–31, Acts 22:6–21, and Acts 26:9–23) with Paul\\'s own statement that he remained unknown to Christians in Judea after that event (Galatians 1:17–24). The author of the Gospel of Luke clearly admired Paul, but his theology was significantly different from Paul\\'s on key points and he does not (in Acts) represent Paul\\'s views accurately.

He is also known as Saint John the Forerunner in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, John the Immerser in some Baptist Christian traditions, and Prophet Yahya in Islam. He is sometimes alternatively referred to as John the Baptiser.\\nJohn is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and he is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baháʼí faith, the Druze faith, and Mandaeism; in the last of these he is considered to be the final and most vital prophet. He is considered to be a prophet of God by all of the aforementioned faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian denominations. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself; in the Gospels, he is portrayed as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus himself identifies John as \"Elijah who is to come\", which is a direct reference to the Book of Malachi (Malachi 4:5), as confirmed by the angel who announced John\\'s birth to his father, Zechariah. According to the Gospel of Luke, John and Jesus were relatives.\\n\\nSome scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes, a semi-ascetic Jewish sect who expected a messiah and practised ritual baptism. John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most biblical scholars agree that John baptized Jesus, and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus\\'s early followers had previously been followers of John. According to the New Testament, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around AD 30 after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife Phasaelis and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I. Josephus also mentions John in the Antiquities of the Jews and states that he was executed by order of Herod Antipas in the fortress at Machaerus.\\nFollowers of John existed well into the 2nd century AD, and some proclaimed him to be the Messiah awaited by Jews. In modern times, the followers of John the Baptist are the Mandaeans, an ancient ethnoreligious group who believe that he is their greatest and final prophet.

He is also known as Saint John the Forerunner in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, John the Immerser in some Baptist Christian traditions, and Prophet Yahya in Islam. He is sometimes alternatively referred to as John the Baptiser.\\nJohn is mentioned by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus and he is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Baháʼí faith, the Druze faith, and Mandaeism; in the last of these he is considered to be the final and most vital prophet. He is considered to be a prophet of God by all of the aforementioned faiths, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian denominations. According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself; in the Gospels, he is portrayed as the precursor or forerunner of Jesus. According to the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus himself identifies John as \"Elijah who is to come\", which is a direct reference to the Book of Malachi (Malachi 4:5), as confirmed by the angel who announced John\\'s birth to his father, Zechariah. According to the Gospel of Luke, John and Jesus were relatives.\\n\\nSome scholars maintain that John belonged to the Essenes, a semi-ascetic Jewish sect who expected a messiah and practised ritual baptism. John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his pre-messianic movement. Most biblical scholars agree that John baptized Jesus, and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus\\'s early followers had previously been followers of John. According to the New Testament, John was sentenced to death and subsequently beheaded by Herod Antipas around AD 30 after John rebuked him for divorcing his wife Phasaelis and then unlawfully wedding Herodias, the wife of his brother Herod Philip I. Josephus also mentions John in the Antiquities of the Jews and states that he was executed by order of Herod Antipas in the fortress at Machaerus.\\nFollowers of John existed well into the 2nd century AD, and some proclaimed him to be the Messiah awaited by Jews. In modern times, the followers of John the Baptist are the Mandaeans, an ancient ethnoreligious group who believe that he is their greatest and final prophet. In the Roman martyrology, apart from Jesus and the Virgin Mary, John is the only saint whose birth and death are both commemorated.\\n\\n\\n== Gospel narratives ==\\n\\nJohn the Baptist is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels and the non-canonical Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Synoptic Gospels (Mark, Matthew and Luke) describe John baptising Jesus; in the Gospel of John this is inferred by many to be referred to in John 1:32.\\n\\n\\n=== In Mark ===\\nThe Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfillment of a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, Malachi and Exodus) about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel\\'s hair, and living on locusts and wild honey. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\\n\\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, Jesus sees the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him \"like a dove\", and he hears a voice from heaven that says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased\".\\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John\\'s death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch Herod Antipas, hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying Herodias, the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias dema'),\n",

What separates the Gospel and the Epistles is not time, place, or content, but author. However, while the texts have a Jewish character, many argue that the three letters are still addressed to Christians and that the congregations to which the letters are written are probably not dominated by Jews.

They argue that the Johannine community can have developed from a similar schismatic Judaism.\\n\\n\\n== Contents ==\\nThe First Epistle of John stands out from the others due to its form, but they're united by language, style, contents, themes, and worldview. The Second and Third Epistles of John are composed as regular greco-roman letters, with greetings and endings, while the First Epistle of John lacks such characteristic markings and instead resembles a sermon or an exhoratory speech. Despite these differences, most scholars consider the personal and warm tone, the fact that the author discusses a certain problem, and the wish to bridge distance, to connect it with regular letter composition, granting that it was meant for a larger audience.

Like man, who has been created totally in God\\'s image, God consists of three different persons - body, soul and spirit - each with his own individual activity, but nevertheless man is only one human being. Likewise Jesus is the only one divine being existing in himself eternally out of a well distinguishable trinity. The Father, Jesus as son and the Holy spirit are distinguishable one and the same from eternity. The father in Jesus is everlasting love. Jesus as the son is light and wisdom, the word of God, which emanates from the fire of everlasting love. The Holy Spirit in God is the will of God, the great pronounced word \\'It shall be!\\' This all is in Jesus: the love, the wisdom and the power. Only one God exists, and this is Jesus, who only took a body on earth, to reveal himself better to the people of the earth.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationship to God ===\\nIn chapter 59 of the first book of the Great Gospel of John, it is described how Jesus corrects a God-fearing man, by telling him it is not right for him to have fear of God as what God wants is love. In future he should love God more than fear Him. In chapter 58 of the second book of the Great Gospel of John verse 3, the angel explains that one should speak to God as if He was one\\'s equal. The highest spiritual perfection in this world, or in the afterlife, is to become boundlessly free, a perfect person, a child of God, one with God and doing what God is doing. The children of God must be perfect, just as God as their true Father Himself is perfect. This is achieved by loving God above all else, and the neighbor as oneself with all patience and with all strength, either in this world or at least in the other world.\\n\\n\\n=== Salvation ===\\nIn chapter 10:17 of the first book of the Great Gospel of John, Lorber explains the gospel of salvation as three steps.\\nFirstly a person needs to master his flesh. Secondly he needs to purify his soul through works of love. Thirdly a person\\'s spirit needs to be awakened from the grave of judgement. These three steps are described as the process of rebirth.

Although there are parallels with the three synoptic gospels, Peter does not use any of the material unique to Matthew or unique to Luke. Raymond E. Brown and others find that the author may have been acquainted with the synoptic gospels and even with the Gospel of John; Brown even suggests that the author\\'s source in the canonical gospels was transmitted orally, through readings in the churches, i.e. that the text is based on what the author remembers about the other gospels, together with their own embellishments.\\nRon Cameron and others have further speculated the Gospel of Peter was written independently of the synoptic gospels using an early proto-gospel. A consequence of this is the potential existence of a source text that formed the basis of the passion narratives in Matthew, Luke, and Mark, as well as in Peter. Origen makes mention of the Gospel of Peter as agreeing with the tradition of the Hebrews. The relationship to the Gospel according to the Hebrews becomes more clear when Theodoret states that the Nazarenes made use of the Gospel of Peter, for it is known by the testimony of the Fathers generally that the Nazarene Gospel was commonly called the Gospel according to the Hebrews. The same Gospel was in use among the Ebionites, and, in fact, as almost all critics are agreed, the Gospel according to the Hebrews – under various names such as the Gospel according to Peter, according to the Apostles, the Nazarenes, Ebionites, Egyptians, etc. – was substantially the same work, circulated very widely throughout the early Church, though with modifications.\\n\\n\\n=== Date ===\\nThe gospel is widely thought to date from after the composition of the four canonical gospels. Scholars are divided as to the exact date of the text, with some placing it in the first half of the 2nd century and considering it to have been compiled based on oral traditions about Jesus, independent of the canonical gospels. The dating of the text depends to a certain extent on whether it is the same \"Gospel of Peter\" condemned by Serapion, Bishop of Antioch upon inspection at Rhossus. The Rhossus community had already been using it in their liturgy.\\nJohn Dominic Crossan argues that the Gospel of Peter, as it is found in the modern day, was composed in the 2nd century but incorporates a passion narrative source that predates all other known passion accounts. He calls this primitive passion source the \"Cross Gospel.\" Crossan asserts that this Cross Gospel was written before the synoptic gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke and that it influenced both them and the Gospel of Peter. Crossan\\'s view is not accepted by mainstream Biblical scholars.\\nCraig A.

Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches generally do not view the New Testament apocrypha as part of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nThe word apocrypha means \\'things put away\\' or \\'things hidden\\', originating from the Medieval Latin adjective apocryphus, \\'secret\\' or \\'non-canonical\\', which in turn originated from the Greek adjective ἀπόκρυφος (apokryphos), \\'obscure\\', from the verb ἀποκρύπτειν (apokryptein), \\'to hide away\\'. Apokryptein in turn comes from the Greek prefix apo-, meaning \\'away\\', and the Greek verb kryptein, meaning \\'to hide\\'.\\nThe general term is usually applied to the books that were considered by the church as useful, but not divinely inspired. As such, to refer to Gnostic writings as \"apocryphal\" is misleading since they would not be classified in the same category by orthodox believers. Often used by the Greek Fathers was the term antilegomena, or \\'spoken against\\', although some canonical books were also spoken against, such as the Apocalypse of John in the East. Often used by scholars is the term pseudepigrapha, meaning \\'falsely inscribed\\' or \\'falsely attributed\\', in the sense that the writings were written by an anonymous author who appended the name of an apostle to his work, such as in the Gospel of Peter or the Ethiopic Apocalypse of Enoch: almost all books, in both Old and New Testaments, called \"apocrypha\" in the Protestant tradition are pseudepigrapha. In the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, what are called the apocrypha by Protestants include the deuterocanonical books: in the Catholic tradition, the term apocrypha is synonymous with what Protestants would call the pseudepigrapha, the latter term of which is almost exclusively used by scholars.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Development of the New Testament canon ===\\n\\nThat some works are categorized as New Testament apocrypha is indicative of the wide range of responses to the ministry of Jesus. During the first centuries following Jesus\\' ministry, considerable debate was held in regards to safeguarding the authenticity of his teachings. Three key methods developed to address this survive to the present day: ordination, where groups authorize individuals as reliable teachers of the message; creeds, where groups define the boundaries of interpretation of the message; and canons, which list the primary documents certain groups believe contain the message originally taught by Jesus.\\nThe first centuries of Christianity saw substantial debate in regards to which books should be included in the canons. In general, those books that the majority regarded as the earliest books about Jesus were the ones included. Books that were not accepted into the canons are now termed apocryphal; some were virgorously suppressed and survive only as fragments, or only in mention in the writings of those condemning them. The earliest lists of canonical works of the New Testament were not quite the same as modern lists; for example, the Book of Revelation was regarded as disputed by some Christians (see Antilegomena), while the Shepherd of Hermas was considered genuine by others, and appears (after the Book of Revelation) in the Codex Sinaiticus.\\nThe Syriac Peshitta, used by all the various Syrian churches, originally did not include 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation. This canon of 22 books is the one cited by John Chrysostom (~347–407) and Theodoret (393–466) from the School of Antioch.

While the periods to which the gospels are usually dated suggest otherwise, convention traditionally holds that the authors were two of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, John and Matthew, as well as two \"apostolic men\", Mark and Luke, whom Orthodox Tradition records as members of the 70 Apostles (Luke 10):\\n\\nMatthew – a former tax collector (Levi) who was called by Jesus to be one of the Twelve Apostles\\nMark – a follower of Peter and so an \"apostolic man\"\\nLuke – a doctor who wrote what is now the book of Luke to Theophilus. Also known to have written the book of Acts (or Acts of the Apostles) and to have been a close friend of Paul of Tarsus\\nJohn – a disciple of Jesus and the youngest of his Twelve Apostles\\nThey are called evangelists, a word meaning \"people who proclaim good news\", because their books aim to tell the \"good news\" (\"gospel\") of Jesus.\\n\\n\\n== Symbols ==\\nIn iconography, the evangelists often appear in Evangelist portraits derived from classical tradition, and are also frequently represented by the symbols which originate from the four \"living creatures\" that draw the throne-chariot of God in the vision in Ezekiel 1 reflected in the Book of Revelation (4:6–9ff), referred to as the four \\'Seraphim\\', though neither source links the creatures to the Evangelists (of course the depiction of the Seraphim predates in chronology the writing of the New Testament which portrays the writers John, Luke, Mark, Matthew as symbolically embodied by the four Seraphim). Images normally, but not invariably, appear with wings like angels. When the symbols of the Four Evangelists appear together, it is called a Tetramorph, common in the Romanesque art of Europe such as church frescoes or murals.\\nThe meanings accruing to the symbols grew over centuries, with an early formulation by Jerome, and were fully expressed by Rabanus Maurus, who set out three layers of meaning for the beasts: representing first the Evangelists, second the nature of Christ, and third the virtues required of a Christian for salvation. These animals may have originally been seen as representing the highest forms of the various types of animals: man, as king of creation, as the image of the creator; the lion, as king of beasts of prey (meat-eating); the ox, as king of domesticated animals (grass-eating); the eagle, as king of birds.\\n\\nMatthew the Evangelist, the author of the first gospel account, is symbolized by a winged man, or angel. Matthew\\'s gospel starts with Joseph\\'s genealogy from Abraham; it represents Jesus\\'s incarnation, and so Christ\\'s human nature. This signifies that Christians should use their reason for salvation.\\nMark the Evangelist, the author of the second gospel account, is symbolized by a winged lion—a figure of courage and monarchy. The lion also represents Jesus\\'s resurrection (because lions were believed to sleep with open eyes, a comparison with Christ in the tomb), and Christ as king. This signifies that Christians should be courageous on the path of salvation.\\nLuke the Evangelist, the author of the third gospel account (and the Acts of the Apostles), is symbolized by a winged ox or bull—a figure of sacrifice, service, and strength. Luke\\'s account begins with the duties of Zechariah in the temple; it represents Jesus\\'s sacrifice in his Passion and Crucifixion, as well as Christ being high priest (this also represents Mary\\'s obedience).

The author of the Gospel of John seemed interested in maintaining the internal anonymity of the author\\'s identity, although interpreting the Gospel in the light of the Synoptic Gospels and considering that the author names (and therefore is not claiming to be) Peter, and that James was martyred as early as AD 44, Christian tradition has widely believed that the author was the Apostle John, though modern scholars believe the work to be pseudepigrapha.\\nChristian tradition says that John the Evangelist was John the Apostle. John, Peter and James the Just were the three pillars of the Jerusalem church after Jesus\\' death. He was one of the original twelve apostles and is thought to be the only one to escape martyrdom. It had been believed that he was exiled (around AD 95) to the Aegean island of Patmos, where he wrote the Book of Revelation.

Some today agree that the gospel and epistles may have been written by a single author, whether or not this was the apostle.\\nOther scholars conclude that the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel, although all four works originated from the same community.  In the 6th century, the Decretum Gelasianum argued that the Second and Third Epistle of John have a separate author known as \"John the priest.\"\\nHistorical critics like H.P.V. Nunn, Reza Aslan and Bart Ehrman, believe with most modern scholars that the apostle John wrote none of these works. Some scholars, though, such as John Robinson, F. F. Bruce, Leon Morris, and Martin Hengel, still hold the apostle to be behind at least some of the works in question, particularly the gospel.\\nThe Book of Revelation is today generally agreed to have a separate author, John of Patmos, c.\\u200995 with some parts possibly dating to Nero\\'s reign in the early 60s.\\n\\n\\n== Feast day ==\\nThe feast day of Saint John in the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Calendar, is on 27 December, the third day of Christmastide.

This theory has its basis in source criticism. Since the commentary of Rudolf Bultmann was published in 1941, the hypothesis of a semeia (sign or miracle) source has gained some acceptance.\\n\\n\\n== Internal evidence ==\\nOne possible construction of the \"internal evidence\" states that the Beloved Disciple wrote an account of the life of Jesus. However, this disciple died unexpectedly, necessitating that a revised gospel be written. In other words, it may be that John “is the source\" of the Johannine tradition but \"not the final writer of the tradition.\"\\n Therefore, scholars are no longer looking for the identity of a single writer but for numerous authors whose authorship has been absorbed into the gospel\\'s development over a period of time and in several stages.\\n\\n\\n== Bultmann ==\\nThe hypothesis of the Gospel of John being composed in layers over a period of time originated in the work of Rudolf Bultmann in 1941. Bultmann suggested that the author(s) of John depended in part on an author who wrote an earlier account. This hypothetical \"Signs Gospel\" listing Christ\\'s miracles was independent of, and not used by, the synoptic gospels. It was believed to have been circulating before the year 70 AD. Bultmann\\'s conclusion was so controversial that heresy proceedings were instituted against him and his writings.\\n\\n\\n== Later scholarship ==\\nNevertheless, this hypothesis has not disappeared. Scholars such as Raymond E. Brown believe the original author of the Signs Gospel to be the Beloved Disciple. They argue that the disciple who formed this community was both a historical person and a companion of Jesus Christ. Brown also suggests that the Beloved Disciple had been a follower of John the Baptist before joining Jesus.\\nIt is now widely agreed that the Gospel of John draws upon a tradition of Miracles of Jesus which is substantially independent of the three synoptic gospels.\\n\\n\\n== Robert T. Fortna ==\\nRobert Fortna, a member of the Jesus Seminar, argued that there are at least two distinct writing styles contained in the Gospel of John. The later style contains highly developed and sophisticated midrash and theological essays attached superficially - even \"mechanically\" at some points - to the former source. The other - earlier - style is the original 2-part Signs Gospel, consisting of a Signs Source (SQ) and a Passion Source (PQ). It is simple, direct and historical in style and can be roughly reconstructed as follows:\\n\\nThe order of the signs in the Gospel of John is different from their order in the reconstructed Signs Gospel. In the Signs Gospel, they are presented in a geographically logical order, going from Galilee to Jerusalem. In the Gospel of John, they have been rearranged to reflect Jesus\\' repeated movements to and from Jerusalem. This would explain some of the geographical difficulties in the Gospel of John, such as the sudden shift from Judaea to Galilee in John 6:1.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Gospels\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nText of the Signs Gospel')]"

    "Position: Software Engineer\n",
    "Date of Review: July 14, 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:\n",
    "Joe is a highly skilled software engineer with a deep understanding of programming languages, algorithms, and software development best practices. His technical expertise shines through in his ability to efficiently solve complex problems and deliver high-quality code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Joe's greatest strengths is his collaborative nature. He actively engages with cross-functional teams, contributing valuable insights and seeking input from others. His open-mindedness and willingness to learn from colleagues make him a true team player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe consistently demonstrates initiative and self-motivation. He takes the lead in seeking out new projects and challenges, and his proactive attitude has led to significant improvements in existing processes and systems. His dedication to self-improvement and growth is commendable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable strength is Joe's adaptability. He has shown great flexibility in handling changing project requirements and learning new technologies. This adaptability allows him to seamlessly transition between different projects and tasks, making him a valuable asset to the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joe's problem-solving skills are exceptional. He approaches issues with a logical mindset and consistently finds effective solutions, often thinking outside the box. His ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts is key to his success in resolving issues efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:\n",
    "While Joe possesses numerous strengths, there are a few areas where he could benefit from improvement. One such area is time management. Occasionally, Joe struggles with effectively managing his time, resulting in missed deadlines or the need for additional support to complete tasks on time. Developing better prioritization and time management techniques would greatly enhance his efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another area for improvement is Joe's written communication skills. While he communicates well verbally, there have been instances where his written documentation lacked clarity, leading to confusion among team members. Focusing on enhancing his written communication abilities will help him effectively convey ideas and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Joe tends to take on too many responsibilities and hesitates to delegate tasks to others. This can result in an excessive workload and potential burnout. Encouraging him to delegate tasks appropriately will not only alleviate his own workload but also foster a more balanced and productive team environment.\n",

This field is created by the alignment of tiny magnetic particles called dipoles, which are present in certain materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt.\\n\\nWhen two magnets are brought near each other, the dipoles in both magnets interact with each other. Like poles, such as north and north or south and south, repel each other, while opposite poles, like north and south, attract each other.\\n\\nThis is because the dipoles in each magnet align themselves in the same direction, either all north or all south, when placed near each other.
