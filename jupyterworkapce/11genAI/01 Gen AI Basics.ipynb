The local pizza joints are top-notch, but don't ask for pineapple as a topping unless you want to start a heated debate.

      "I. Prologue[a]Chapter 11 In the beginning[b] was the Word,    and the Word was with God,    and the Word was God.(A)2 He was in the beginning with God.3 [c]All things came to be through him,    and without him nothing came to be.(B)What came to be  4 through him was life,    and this life was the light of the human race;(C)5 [d]the light shines in the darkness,(D)    and the darkness has not overcome it. 6 [e]A man named John was sent from God.(E)  7 He came for testimony,[f] to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.(F)  8 He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.(G)  9 The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.(H) 10 He was in the world,    and the world came to be through him,    but the world did not know him.11 He came to what was his own,    but his own people[g] did not accept him. 12 (I)But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,  13 [h](J)who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man’s decision but of God. 14 And the Word became flesh[i]    and made his dwelling among us,    and we saw his glory,    the glory as of the Father’s only Son,    full of grace and truth.(K) 15 [j]John testified to him and cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said,(L) ‘The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’”  16 From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace,[k]  17 because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.(M)  18 No one has ever seen God. The only Son, God,[l] who is at the Father’s side, has revealed him.(N) II. The Book of SignsJohn the Baptist’s Testimony to Himself. 19 [m]And this is the testimony of John. When the Jews[n] from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites [to him] to ask him, “Who are you?”  20 [o]he admitted and did not deny it, but admitted,(O) “I am not the Messiah.”  21 So they asked him, “What are you then? Are you Elijah?”[p] And he said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”(P)  22 So they said to him, “Who are you, so we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you have to say for yourself?”  23 He said:“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the desert,(Q)“Make straight the way of the Lord,”’[q]as Isaiah the prophet said.”  24 Some Pharisees[r] were also sent.  25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?”(R)  26 John answered them, “I baptize with water;[s] but there is one among you whom you do not recognize,(S)  27 the one who is coming after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.”  28 This happened in Bethany across the Jordan,[t] where John was baptizing. John the Baptist’s Testimony to Jesus. 29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God,[u] who takes away the sin of the world.(T)  30 [v]He is the one of whom I said,(U) ‘A man is coming after me who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.’  31 I did not know him,[w] but the reason why I came baptizing with water was that he might be made known to Israel.”  32 John testified further, saying, “I saw the Spirit come down like a dove[x] from the sky and remain upon him.  33 I did not know him,(V) but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.’(W)  34 [y](X)Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God.”The First Disciples.(Y)  35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples,  36 and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God.”[z]  37 The two disciples[aa] heard what he said and followed Jesus.  38 Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, “What are you looking for?” They said to him, “Rabbi” (which translated means Teacher), “where are you staying?”  39 He said to them, “Come, and you will see.” So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four in the afternoon.[ab]  40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.  41 He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah”[ac] (which is translated Anointed).(Z)  42 Then he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John;[ad] you will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).(AA) 43 The next day he[ae] decided to go to Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me.”  44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.  45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the law, and also the prophets, Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”(AB)  46 But Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”  47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Here is a true Israelite.[af] There is no duplicity in him.”  48 [ag](AC)Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”  49 Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God;[ah] you are the King of Israel.”(AD)  50 Jesus answered and said to him, “Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree?[ai] You will see greater things than this.”  51 And he said to him, “Amen, amen,[aj] I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”(AE) \n",
      "Footnotes1:1–18 The prologue states the main themes of the gospel: life, light, truth, the world, testimony, and the preexistence of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Logos, who reveals God the Father. In origin, it was probably an early Christian hymn. Its closest parallel is in other christological hymns, Col 1:15–20 and Phil 2:6–11. Its core (Jn 1:1–5, 10–11, 14) is poetic in structure, with short phrases linked by “staircase parallelism,” in which the last word of one phrase becomes the first word of the next. Prose inserts (at least Jn 1:6–8, 15) deal with John the Baptist.\n",
      "1:1 In the beginning: also the first words of the Old Testament (Gn 1:1). Was: this verb is used three times with different meanings in this verse: existence, relationship, and predication. The Word (Greek logos): this term combines God’s dynamic, creative word (Genesis), personified preexistent Wisdom as the instrument of God’s creative activity (Proverbs), and the ultimate intelligibility of reality (Hellenistic philosophy). With God: the Greek preposition here connotes communication with another. Was God: lack of a definite article with “God” in Greek signifies predication rather than identification.\n",
      "1:3 What came to be: while the oldest manuscripts have no punctuation here, the corrector of Bodmer Papyrus P75, some manuscripts, and the Ante-Nicene Fathers take this phrase with what follows, as staircase parallelism. Connection with Jn 1:3 reflects fourth-century anti-Arianism.\n",
      "1:5 The ethical dualism of light and darkness is paralleled in intertestamental literature and in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Overcome: “comprehend” is another possible translation, but cf. Jn 12:35; Wis 7:29–30.\n",
      "1:6 John was sent just as Jesus was “sent” (Jn 4:34) in divine mission. Other references to John the Baptist in this gospel emphasize the differences between them and John’s subordinate role.\n",
      "1:7 Testimony: the testimony theme of John is introduced, which portrays Jesus as if on trial throughout his ministry. All testify to Jesus: John the Baptist, the Samaritan woman, scripture, his works, the crowds, the Spirit, and his disciples.\n",
      "1:11 What was his own…his own people: first a neuter, literally, “his own property/possession” (probably = Israel), then a masculine, “his own people” (the Israelites).\n",
      "1:13 Believers in Jesus become children of God not through any of the three natural causes mentioned but through God who is the immediate cause of the new spiritual life. Were born: the Greek verb can mean “begotten” (by a male) or “born” (from a female or of parents). The variant “he who was begotten,” asserting Jesus’ virginal conception, is weakly attested in Old Latin and Syriac versions.\n",
      "1:14 Flesh: the whole person, used probably against docetic tendencies (cf. 1 Jn 4:2; 2 Jn 7). Made his dwelling: literally, “pitched his tent/tabernacle.” Cf. the tabernacle or tent of meeting that was the place of God’s presence among his people (Ex 25:8–9). The incarnate Word is the new mode of God’s presence among his people. The Greek verb has the same consonants as the Aramaic word for God’s presence (Shekinah). Glory: God’s visible manifestation of majesty in power, which once filled the tabernacle (Ex 40:34) and the temple (1 Kgs 8:10–11, 27), is now centered in Jesus. Only Son: Greek, monogenēs, but see note on Jn 1:18. Grace and truth: these words may represent two Old Testament terms describing Yahweh in covenant relationship with Israel (cf. Ex 34:6), thus God’s “love” and “fidelity.” The Word shares Yahweh’s covenant qualities.\n",
      "1:15 This verse, interrupting Jn 1:14, 16 seems drawn from Jn 1:30.\n",
      "1:16 Grace in place of grace: replacement of the Old Covenant with the New (cf. Jn 1:17). Other possible translations are “grace upon grace” (accumulation) and “grace for grace” (correspondence).\n",
      "1:18 The only Son, God: while the vast majority of later textual witnesses have another reading, “the Son, the only one” or “the only Son,” the translation above follows the best and earliest manuscripts, monogenēs theos, but takes the first term to mean not just “Only One” but to include a filial relationship with the Father, as at Lk 9:38 (“only child”) or Hb 11:17 (“only son”) and as translated at Jn 1:14. The Logos is thus “only Son” and God but not Father/God.\n",
      "1:19–51 The testimony of John the Baptist about the Messiah and Jesus’ self-revelation to the first disciples. This section constitutes the introduction to the gospel proper and is connected with the prose inserts in the prologue. It develops the major theme of testimony in four scenes: John’s negative testimony about himself; his positive testimony about Jesus; the revelation of Jesus to Andrew and Peter; the revelation of Jesus to Philip and Nathanael.\n",
      "1:19 The Jews: throughout most of the gospel, the “Jews” does not refer to the Jewish people as such but to the hostile authorities, both Pharisees and Sadducees, particularly in Jerusalem, who refuse to believe in Jesus. The usage reflects the atmosphere, at the end of the first century, of polemics between church and synagogue, or possibly it refers to Jews as representative of a hostile world (Jn 1:10–11).\n",
      "1:20 Messiah: the anointed agent of Yahweh, usually considered to be of Davidic descent. See further the note on Jn 1:41.\n",
      "1:21 Elijah: the Baptist did not claim to be Elijah returned to earth (cf. Mal 3:19; Mt 11:14). The Prophet: probably the prophet like Moses (Dt 18:15; cf. Acts 3:22).\n",
      "1:23 This is a repunctuation and reinterpretation (as in the synoptic gospels and Septuagint) of the Hebrew text of Is 40:3 which reads, “A voice cries out: In the desert prepare the way of the Lord.”\n",
      "1:24 Some Pharisees: other translations, such as “Now they had been sent from the Pharisees,” misunderstand the grammatical construction. This is a different group from that in Jn 1:19; the priests and Levites would have been Sadducees, not Pharisees.\n",
      "1:26 I baptize with water: the synoptics add “but he will baptize you with the holy Spirit” (Mk 1:8) or “…holy Spirit and fire” (Mt 3:11; Lk 3:16). John’s emphasis is on purification and preparation for a better baptism.\n",
      "1:28 Bethany across the Jordan: site unknown. Another reading is “Bethabara.”\n",
      "1:29 The Lamb of God: the background for this title may be the victorious apocalyptic lamb who would destroy evil in the world (Rev 5–7; 17:14); the paschal lamb, whose blood saved Israel (Ex 12); and/or the suffering servant led like a lamb to the slaughter as a sin-offering (Is 53:7, 10).\n",
      "1:30 He existed before me: possibly as Elijah (to come, Jn 1:27); for the evangelist and his audience, Jesus’ preexistence would be implied (see note on Jn 1:1).\n",
      "1:31 I did not know him: this gospel shows no knowledge of the tradition (Lk 1) about the kinship of Jesus and John the Baptist. The reason why I came baptizing with water: in this gospel, John’s baptism is not connected with forgiveness of sins; its purpose is revelatory, that Jesus may be made known to Israel.\n",
      "1:32 Like a dove: a symbol of the new creation (Gn 8:8) or the community of Israel (Hos 11:11). Remain: the first use of a favorite verb in John, emphasizing the permanency of the relationship between Father and Son (as here) and between the Son and the Christian. Jesus is the permanent bearer of the Spirit.\n",
      "1:34 The Son of God: this reading is supported by good Greek manuscripts, including the Chester Beatty and Bodmer Papyri and the Vatican Codex, but is suspect because it harmonizes this passage with the synoptic version: “This is my beloved Son” (Mt 3:17; Mk 1:11; Lk 3:22). The poorly attested alternate reading, “God’s chosen One,” is probably a reference to the Servant of Yahweh (Is 42:1).\n",
      "1:36 John the Baptist’s testimony makes his disciples’ following of Jesus plausible.\n",
      "1:37 The two disciples: Andrew (Jn 1:40) and, traditionally, John, son of Zebedee (see note on Jn 13:23).\n",
      "1:39 Four in the afternoon: literally, the tenth hour, from sunrise, in the Roman calculation of time. Some suggest that the next day, beginning at sunset, was the sabbath; they would have stayed with Jesus to avoid travel on it.\n",
      "1:41 Messiah: the Hebrew word māšîaḥ, “anointed one” (see note on Lk 2:11), appears in Greek as the transliterated messias only here and in Jn 4:25. Elsewhere the Greek translation christos is used.\n",
      "1:42 Simon, the son of John: in Mt 16:17, Simon is called Bariōna, “son of Jonah,” a different tradition for the name of Simon’s father. Cephas: in Aramaic = the Rock; cf. Mt 16:18. Neither the Greek equivalent Petros nor, with one isolated exception, Cephas is attested as a personal name before Christian times.\n",
      "1:43 He: grammatically, could be Peter, but logically is probably Jesus.\n",
      "1:47 A true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him: Jacob was the first to bear the name “Israel” (Gn 32:29), but Jacob was a man of duplicity (Gn 27:35–36).\n",
      "1:48 Under the fig tree: a symbol of messianic peace (cf. Mi 4:4; Zec 3:10).\n",
      "1:49 Son of God: this title is used in the Old Testament, among other ways, as a title of adoption for the Davidic king (2 Sm 7:14; Ps 2:7; 89:27), and thus here, with King of Israel, in a messianic sense. For the evangelist, Son of God also points to Jesus’ divinity (cf. Jn 20:28).\n",
      "1:50 Possibly a statement: “You [singular] believe because I saw you under the fig tree.”\n",
      "1:51 The double “Amen” is characteristic of John. You is plural in Greek. The allusion is to Jacob’s ladder (Gn 28:12).\n",

       "[Document(page_content='The Gospel of John (Ancient Greek: Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ἰωάννην, romanized: Euangélion katà Iōánnēn) is the fourth of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus) and seven \"I am\" discourses (concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition) culminating in Thomas\\' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\".

John 21:22 references a disciple whom Jesus loved and John 21:24–25 says: \"This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true...\" Early Christian tradition, first found in Irenaeus (c.\\u2009130 – c.\\u2009202 AD), identified this disciple with John the Apostle, but most scholars have abandoned this hypothesis or hold it only tenuously – there are multiple reasons for this conclusion, including, for example, the fact that the gospel is written in good Greek and displays sophisticated theology, and is therefore unlikely to have been the work of a simple fisherman. These verses imply rather that the core of the gospel relies on the testimony (perhaps written) of the \"disciple who is testifying\", as collected, preserved and reshaped by a community of followers (the \"we\" of the passage), and that a single follower (the \"I\") rearranged this material and perhaps added the final chapter and other passages to produce the final gospel. Most scholars estimate the final form of the text to be around AD 90–110. Given its complex history there may have been more than one place of composition, and while the author was familiar with Jewish customs and traditions, his frequent clarification of these implies that he wrote for a mixed Jewish/Gentile or Jewish context outside Palestine.The author may have drawn on a \"signs source\" (a collection of miracles) for chapters 1–12, a \"passion source\" for the story of Jesus\\'s arrest and crucifixion, and a \"sayings source\" for the discourses, but these hypotheses are much debated. He seems to have known some version of Mark and Luke, as he shares with them some items of vocabulary and clusters of incidents arranged in the same order, but key terms from those gospels are absent or nearly so, implying that if he did know them he felt free to write independently. The Hebrew scriptures were an important source, with 14 direct quotations (versus 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke), and their influence is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included, but the majority of John\\'s direct quotations do not agree exactly with any known version of the Jewish scriptures. Recent arguments by Richard Bauckham and others that the Gospel of John preserves eyewitness testimony have not won general acceptance.\\n\\n\\n=== Setting: the Johannine community debate ===\\nFor much of the 20th century, scholars interpreted the Gospel of John within the paradigm of a hypothetical \"Johannine community\", meaning that the gospel sprang from a late-1st-century Christian community excommunicated from the Jewish synagogue (probably meaning the Jewish community) o', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of John', 'summary': 'The Gospel of John (Ancient Greek: Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ἰωάννην, romanized: Euangélion katà Iōánnēn) is the fourth of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament.

The Greek term was Latinized as evangelium in the Vulgate, and translated into Latin as bona annuntiatio. In Old English, it was translated as gōdspel (gōd \"good\" + spel \"news\").

Each has its own distinctive understanding of him and his divine role and scholars recognize that the differences of detail between the gospels are irreconcilable, and any attempt to harmonize them would only disrupt their distinct theological messages.Matthew, Mark and Luke are termed the synoptic gospels because they present very similar accounts of the life of Jesus. Mark begins with the baptism of the adult Jesus and the heavenly declaration that he is the son of God; he gathers followers and begins his ministry, and tells his disciples that he must die in Jerusalem but that he will rise; in Jerusalem, he is at first acclaimed but then rejected, betrayed, and crucified, and when the women who have followed him come to his tomb they find it empty.

Nicodemus is never mentioned in the synoptic Gospels, and this is one of four times John mentions him: the others are 2:23–25, where he appeared but was unmentioned; 7:50; and 19:39. The meeting, likely in Jerusalem, is part of the passion of Jesus. Unlike Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Gospel of John is the only one to mention Jesus\\' life not in chronological order.Nicodemus was a member of the Pharisees, a Jewish religious movement in Second Temple Judaism. It was known for its strict adherence to the halakha (Jewish law), and for its highly oppositional attitudes of the ministry of Jesus. To avoid trouble with other Pharisees, Nicodemus came to Jesus at night; it is the only time a Pharisee is presented positively in the presence of Jesus. Later, Nicodemus became a follower of Jesus.Nicodemus said he knew Jesus was \"a teacher who came from God\". He then added: \"For no-one could perform the miraculous signs he was doing if God were not with him.\" They then discussed the need to be born again before being able to see the Kingdom of God and where the spirit goes after the death of the body. Jesus then spoke about salvation and of the damnation that those who do not believe in him will face. He also criticised Nicodemus for his lack in the understanding of theology.\\n\\n\\n== Translations ==\\nSome of translations for the verse have been provided as below:\\nIt can be seen that:\\n\\nsome translations (e.g., the Mercian) negate the perishing while most (e.g., the West Saxon) negate the everyone;\\nsome translations have \"only\", others have \"only begotten\";\\nLuther and Wright favour \"lost\" over \"perish\".\\n\\n\\n== Analysis ==\\n\\n\\n=== Exegesis ===\\nJohn 3:16 has been termed as \"the golden text of the Bible\", \"the gospel in a nutshell\", and \"everyman\\'s text\". One of the verses pivotal to the Johannine theology, it concerns God\\'s motive for sending Jesus.  In Christianity, it is thought that believing in Jesus grants eternal life to the believer. Eternal life is a dominant theme throughout John\\'s entire Gospel, and its first appearance in the Gospel is in this verse. Theologian Larry Hurtado sees the verse as reflecting Jesus\\' importance in Christianity. The Methodist minister C. K. Barrett wrote, \"Mention of ... the eternal life given ... to believers ... suggests ... the general setting of the work of Christ in the love and judgement of God.\"The verse (which has parallels with John 3:15 and John 3:17) has been used by some to support Christian universalism, a view that all humans will eventually be saved by God or denies eternal suffering in Hell. However, Anglican bishop N. T. Wright has argued against this, saying that the \"position is quite clear: God in His great love has made one way of salvation for all men without exception. Those who refuse this way have no alternative left to them. And accepting the way of salvation, for John as for Paul, is bound up with faith in Jesus Christ.\"\\n\\n\\n==== Purpose ====\\nTheologians have assumed the verse\\'s purpose to be that of strengthening the ', metadata={'title': 'John 3:16', 'summary': \"John 3:16 is the sixteenth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel of John, one of the four gospels in the New Testament.

All four works contained in the manuscript are written in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic. Two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary have been discovered since, both written in Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus L 3525 and Papyrus Rylands 463). P.Oxy.

Parsons.The two fragments were published in 1938 and 1983 respectively, and the Coptic translation was published in 1955 by Walter Till.Dating the gospel, as with most ancient literary texts, is problematic. As the earliest extant fragment of the gospel (the Rylands papyrus) dates to the early Third Century, it must predate this. Karen L. King, Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, suggested that the gospel was composed early in the Second Century, noting that it evidences familiarity with the Gospel of John, and perhaps the letters of Paul, thus likely postdating 90–100 CE. Christopher Tuckett\\'s discussion in his 2007 volume notes Pasquier\\'s preference for a date in the second half of the century; Tuckett himself ultimately opts for a middle position – he places it in the first half of the Second Century but later than King.The Gospel of Mary is not present in the list of apocryphal books of section five of the Decretum Gelasianum.\\n\\n\\n== The identity of \"Mary\" ==\\nScholars do not always agree which of the New Testament people named Mary is the central character of the Gospel of Mary. Stephen J. Shoemaker and F. Stanley Jones have suggested that she may be Mary the mother of Jesus. Barbara J. Silvertsen alternatively suggests that she may be a sister of Jesus - an individual who has largely been lost in history.  Silvertsen says that while none of the canonical Gospels identifies Jesus\\'s sisters by name (Mark 6:3, Matthew 13:56), one of his sisters is identified as \"Mary\" in the Gospel of Philip.Arguments in favor of Mary Magdalene are based on her status as a known follower of Jesus, her appearance in other early Christian writings. She is mentioned as accompanying Jesus on his journeys (Luke 8:2) and is listed in the Gospel of Matthew as being present at his crucifixion (Matthew 27:56) and along with the ‘other Mary’ being the first to see the Risen Lord (Matthew 28:9 In the Gospel of John, she is recorded as the sole first witness of Jesus’ resurrection (John 20:14–16); (Mark 16:9 later manuscripts).Esther A. de Boer compares her role in other non-canonical texts, noting that \"in the Gospel of Mary it is Peter who is opposed to Mary’s words, because she is a woman. Peter has the same role in the Gospel of Thomas and in Pistis Sophia. In Pistis Sophia the Mary concerned is identified as Mary Magdalene.\" The final scene in the Gospel of Mary may also provide evidence that Mary is indeed Mary Magdalene. Levi, in his defense of Mary and her teaching, tells Peter, \"Surely the Saviour knows her very well. That is why he loved her more than us.\" In the Gospel of Philip, a similar statement is made about Mary Magdalene.King also argues in favor of naming Mary Magdalene as the central figure in the Gospel of Mary. She summarizes: “It was precisely the traditions of Mary as a woman, as an exemplary disciple, a witness to the ministry of Jesus, a visionary of the glorified Jesus, and someone traditionally in contest with Peter, that made her the only figure who ', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of Mary', 'summary': 'The Gospel of Mary is a non-canonical text discovered in 1896 in a fifth-century papyrus codex written in Sahidic Coptic.

It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death, the burial of his body, and the discovery of his empty tomb. It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker, though it does not mention a miraculous birth or divine pre-existence. He refers to himself as the Son of Man. He is called the Son of God but keeps his messianic nature secret; even his disciples fail to understand him. All this is in keeping with the Christian interpretation of prophecy, which is believed to foretell the fate of the messiah as suffering servant.Some critical scholars reject the early church tradition linking the gospel to John Mark, who was a companion of Saint Peter, and it is generally agreed that it was written anonymously for a gentile audience, probably in Rome, sometime shortly before or after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\n\\n\\n=== Authorship and date ===\\nAn early Christian tradition deriving from Papias of Hierapolis (c.60–c.130 AD) attributes authorship of the gospel to Mark, a companion and interpreter of Peter, but most scholars believe that it was written anonymously, and that the name of Mark was attached later to link it to an authoritative figure. It is usually dated through the eschatological discourse in Mark 13, which scholars interpret as pointing to the First Jewish–Roman War (66–74 AD)—a war that led to the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. This would place the composition of Mark either immediately after the destruction or during the years immediately prior. The author used a variety of pre-existing sources, such as conflict stories, apocalyptic discourse, miracle stories, parables, a passion narrative, and collections of sayings, although not the hypothesized Q source.\\n\\n\\n=== Setting ===\\nThe Gospel of Mark was written in Greek, for a gentile audience, and probably in Rome, although Galilee, Antioch (third-largest city in the Roman Empire, located in northern Syria), and southern Syria have also been suggested.The consensus among modern scholars is that the gospels are a subset of the ancient genre of bios, or ancient biography. Ancient biographies were concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject\\'s reputation and memory, and also included morals, rhetoric, propaganda and kerygma (preaching) in their works. Like all the synoptic gospels, the purpose of writing was to strengthen the faith of those who already believed, as opposed to serving as a tractate for missionary conversion. Christian churches were small communities of believers, often based on households (an autocratic patriarch plus extended family, slaves, freedmen, and other clients), and the evangelists often wrote on two levels: one the \"historical\" presentation of the story of Jesus, the other dealing with the concerns of the author\\'s own day. Thus the proclamation of Jesus in Mark 1:14 and the following verses, for example, mixes the terms Jesus would have used as a 1st-century Jew (\"kingdom of God\") and those of the early church (\"believe\", \"gospel\").\\nChristianity began within Judaism, with a Christian \"church\" (or ἐκκλησία, ekklesia, meaning \\'assembly\\') that arose shortly after Jesus\\'s death when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead. From the outset, Christians depended heavily on Jewish literature, supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures. Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the son of God and the son of man, the suffering servant, the Day of the Lord, and the kingdom of God. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that the end of history was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centr', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of Mark', 'summary': 'The Gospel of Mark is the second of the four canonical gospels and one of the three synoptic Gospels.

He is called the Son of God but keeps his messianic nature secret; even his disciples fail to understand him. All this is in keeping with the Christian interpretation of prophecy, which is believed to foretell the fate of the messiah as suffering servant.Some critical scholars reject the early church tradition linking the gospel to John Mark, who was a companion of Saint Peter, and it is generally agreed that it was written anonymously for a gentile audience, probably in Rome, sometime shortly before or after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark'}),\n",

The earliest witnesses (the technical term for written manuscripts) for the Gospel of Luke fall into two \"families\" with considerable differences between them, the Western and the Alexandrian text-type, and the dominant view is that the Western text represents a process of deliberate revision, as the variations seem to form specific patterns.The fragment 𝔓4 is often cited as the oldest witness. It has been dated from the late 2nd century, although this dating is disputed. Papyrus 75 (= Papyrus Bodmer XIV–XV) is another very early manuscript (late 2nd/early 3rd century), and it includes an attribution of the Gospel to Luke.\\nThe oldest complete texts are the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, both from the Alexandrian family; Codex Bezae, a 5th- or 6th-century Western text-type manuscript that contains Luke in Greek and Latin versions on facing pages, appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points.\\nCodex Bezae shows comprehensively the differences between the versions which show no core theological significance.\\n\\n\\n=== Luke–Acts: unity, authorship and date ===\\n\\nThe gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles make up a two-volume work which scholars call Luke–Acts. Together they account for 27.5% of the New Testament, the largest contribution by a single author, providing the framework for both the Church\\'s liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of Jesus.The author is not named in either volume. According to a Church tradition, first attested by Irenaeus (c.\\u2009130 – c.\\u2009202 AD), he was the Luke named as a companion of Paul in three of the Pauline letters, but \"a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.\" An example can be seen by comparing Acts\\' accounts of Paul\\'s conversion (Acts 9:1–31, Acts 22:6–21, and Acts 26:9–23) with Paul\\'s own statement that he remained unknown to Christians in Judea after that event (Galatians 1:17–24). The author of the Gospel of Luke clearly admired Paul, but his theology was significantly different from Paul\\'s on key points and he does not (in Acts) represent Paul\\'s views accurately. He was educated, a man of means, probably urban, and someone who respected manual work, although not a worker himself; this is significant, because more high-brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small busines', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of Luke', 'summary': 'The Gospel of Luke tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.

       " Document(page_content='The Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate (Latin: Acta Pilati; Greek: Πράξεις Πιλάτου, translit. Praxeis Pilatou), is an apocryphal gospel claimed to have been derived from an original Hebrew work written by Nicodemus, who appears in the Gospel of John as an associate of Jesus. The title \"Gospel of Nicodemus\" is medieval in origin. The dates of its accreted sections are uncertain, but the work in its existing form is thought to date to around the 4th or 5th century AD.The author was probably a Hellenistic Jew who converted to Christianity, or, as Tischendorf and Maury conclude, a Christian imbued with Judaic and Gnostic beliefs.\\n\\n\\n== History and authenticity ==\\nThe oldest sections of the book appear first in Greek. The text contains multiple parts, which are uneven in style and would seem to be by different authors. A prologue found in some versions asserts that the text is a translation into Greek of eyewitness accounts found in the praetorium at Jerusalem. The question of the original language is debated. Beyond Greek, the versions in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Slavonic, and other languages have survived.The prevailing view is that the Christian Acts of Pilate were first devised and published as a confutation to an earlier pagan and anti-Christian work also known as the Acts of Pilate. It can be shown that the work behind the Christian Acts of Pilate must have originated very early, but the complete work in its existing form dates to no earlier than the 4th or 5th century. Although \"the Acts of Pontius Pilate\" are mentioned by Justin Martyr in his First Apology (c.\\u2009155 AD), this simply refers to unspecified records which Justin assumed must exist. Church historian  Eusebius of Caesarea (writing c.\\u2009325 AD) shows no acquaintance with this Gospel, despite being aware of related texts (such as the \"Letters of Pilate\" referred to by Justin and Tertullian as well as a pagan version of the Acts of Pilate). Epiphanius refers to an Acta Pilati (c.\\u2009376 AD), but the extant Greek texts show evidence of later editing.\\n\\n\\n== Contents ==\\nThe main body of the Gospel of Nicodemus is in two parts. The first part contains the trial of Jesus (chapters i–xi) and an account of the Resurrection (chapters xii–xvi). The narrative of the trial is based upon Luke 23. In addition to the Greek and Latin witnesses of the first part, there are three other notable ancient versions in Syriac, Armenian, and Coptic. The second part (chapters xvii–xxvii) contains the story of the Harrowing of Hell. In it, Leucius and Charinus, two souls raised from the dead after the crucifixion, relate to the Sanhedrin the circumstances of the descent of Christ into Hell, and the deliverance of the righteous Old Testament patriarchs. It also describes the salvation of Saint Dismas, the penitent thief. This section is a later addition to the Acts, but is probably based upon an older document. It appears most often in the Latin manuscripts, and only rarely in Greek.Some Latin manuscripts contain an appended text, the Letter of Pilate to Claudius. This purports to be an official report made by Pontius Pilate to Claudius containing a description of the crucifixion, as well as an account of the resurrection of Jesus. This text is also found in the Greek Acts of Peter and Paul. One series of Latin manuscripts also includes the episode Cura Sanitatis Tiberii (\"The Cure of Tiberius\"), the oldest form of the legend of Saint Veronica.\\n\\n\\n== Significance ==\\nThe Gospel of Nicodemus has had a long history inspiring devotional works. A Meditatione sopra la Passione del nostro signore Iesu Christo, drawing in part on this gospel for its expanded anecdotal elements in the Passion, was printed 28 times in Italy between about 1476 and 1500, and inspired the depiction of Christ before Pilate by Pontormo.The Gospel of Nicodemus names several minor New Testament figures who were not named in the canonical texts; for example, the soldier who speared Jesus on the cross is named ', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of Nicodemus', 'summary': 'The Gospel of Nicodemus, also known as the Acts of Pilate (Latin: Acta Pilati; Greek: Πράξεις Πιλάτου, translit.

       " Document(page_content='The Apocryphon of John, also called the Secret Book of John or the Secret Revelation of John, is a 2nd-century Sethian Gnostic Christian pseudepigraphical text attributed to John the Apostle. It is one of the texts addressed by Irenaeus in his Against Heresies, placing its composition before 180 AD. It is presented as describing Jesus appearing and giving secret knowledge (gnosis) to his disciple John. The author describes it as having occurred after Jesus had \"gone back to the place from which he came\".\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nMany second-century Christians, both Gnostic and orthodox, hoped to receive a transcendent personal revelation such as Paul the Apostle reported to the church at Corinth (2 Corinthians 12:1–4) or that John experienced on the isle of Patmos, which inspired the Book of Revelation. As Acts narrates what happened after the time Jesus ascended to heaven, so the Apocryphon of John begins at the same point but relates how Christ reappeared to John.\\nThe opening words of the Secret Book of John are, \"The teaching of the saviour, and the revelation of the mysteries and the things hidden in silence, even these things which he taught John, his disciple.\" The author John is immediately specified as \"John, the brother of James—who are the sons of Zebedee.\" The remainder of the book is a vision of spiritual realms and of the prior history of spiritual humanity.\\nThere are four separate surviving manuscripts of \"The Secret Book of John\".  One was purchased in Egypt in 1896 (the Berlin Codex) and three were found in the Nag Hammadi codices discovered in 1945.  All date to the 4th century and are Coptic translations from Greek. Three appear to have been independently produced. Two of the four are similar enough that they probably were copied from a single source.Although the different versions of the texts have minor variants (the Berlin Codex has many minor differences with Nag Hammadi II and IV), all texts generally agree on the assertion that the main revealing entity was Jesus.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nA book called the Apocryphon of John was referred to by Irenaeus in Adversus Haereses, written about 185, among \"an indescribable number of secret and illegitimate writings, which they themselves have forged, to bewilder the minds of foolish people, who are ignorant of the true scriptures\"—scriptures which Irenaeus himself helped to establish (see the canonical four). Among the writings he quotes from, in order to expose and refute them, are the Gospel of Truth, Gospel of Judas, and this secret book of John.Little more was known of this text until 1945, when a cache of thirteen papyrus codices (bound books) that had been hidden away in the 4th century, was fortuitously discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt (CG II). The Apocryphon of John was among the texts, in three Coptic versions translated from the Greek. Two of the versions are very similar and represent one manuscript tradition; they incorporate a lengthy excerpt from a certain Book of Zoroaster appended to the Apocryphon (as chapters 15:29 – 19:8f) A shorter version of the Apocryphon found at Nag Hammadi does not contain the interpolation and represents another manuscript tradition. Still another version of this short edition of the text was discovered in an ancient Coptic Codex acquired by Dr. Carl Reinhardt in Cairo in 1896. This manuscript (identified as the \"Berlin Gnostic Codex\" or BG 8502) was used along with the three versions found at Nag Hammadi to produce the translations now available.  The fact that four manuscript \"editions\" of this text survived—two \"long\" versions and two \"short\" versions—suggests how important this text was in early gnostic Christian circles.

According to church tradition, their mother was Salome. Also according to some traditions, Salome was the sister of Mary, Jesus\\' mother, making Salome Jesus\\' aunt, and her sons John the Apostle and James were Jesus\\' cousins.John the Apostle is traditionally believed to be one of two disciples (the other being Andrew) recounted in John 1:35–39, who upon hearing the Baptist point out Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\", followed Jesus and spent the day with him, thus becoming the first two disciples called by Jesus. On this basis some traditions believe that John was first a disciple of John the Baptist, even though he is not named in this episode.According to the Synoptic Gospels (Matt 4:18–22; Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11), Zebedee and his sons fished in the Sea of Galilee. Jesus then called Peter, Andrew and the two sons of Zebedee to follow him. James and John are listed among the Twelve Apostles. Jesus referred to the pair as \"Boanerges\" (translated \"sons of thunder\"). A Gospel story relates how the brothers wanted to call down heavenly fire on an unhospitable Samaritan town, but Jesus rebuked them. John was also the disciple who reported to Jesus that they had \\'forbidden\\' a non-disciple from casting out demons in Jesus\\' name, prompting Jesus to state that \\'he who is not against us is on our side\\'.John is traditionally believed to have lived on for more than fifty years after the martyrdom of his brother James, who became the first Apostle to die a martyr\\'s death in AD 44.\\n\\n\\n=== Position among the apostles ===\\nJohn is always mentioned in the group of the first four apostles in the Gospels and in the Book of Acts, listed either second, third or fourth.John, along with his brother James and Peter, formed an informal triumvirate among the Twelve Apostles in the Gospels. Jesus allowed them to be the only apostles present at three particular occasions during his public ministry, the Raising of Jairus\\' daughter, Transfiguration of Jesus and Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.Jesus sent only Peter and John into the city to make the preparation for the final Passover meal (the Last Supper).Many traditions identify the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\"', metadata={'title': 'John the Apostle', 'summary': \"John the Apostle (Ancient Greek: Ἰωάννης; Latin: Ioannes c.\\u20096 AD – c.\\u2009100 AD; Ge'ez: ዮሐንስ;), also known as Saint John the Beloved and, in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Saint John the Theologian, was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament.

Cook, Professor of Intertestamental and Early Christian Literature at the Hebrew Union College, there are ten themes in the New Testament that have been sources of anti-Judaism and antisemitism:\\n\\nThe Jews are culpable for crucifying Jesus – as such they are guilty of deicide.\\nThe tribulations of the Jewish people throughout history constitute God\\'s punishment of them for killing Jesus.\\nJesus originally came to preach only to the Jews, but when they rejected him, he abandoned them for gentiles instead.\\nThe Children of Israel were God\\'s original chosen people by virtue of an ancient covenant, but by rejecting Jesus they forfeited their chosenness - and now, by virtue of a New Covenant (or \"testament\"), Christians have replaced the Jews as God\\'s chosen people, the Church having become the \"People of God.\"\\nThe Jewish Bible (\"Old\" Testament) repeatedly portrays the opaqueness and stubbornness of the Jewish people and their disloyalty to God.\\nThe Jewish Bible contains many predictions of the coming of Jesus as the Messiah (or \"Christ\"), yet the Jews are blind to the meaning of their own Bible.\\nBy the time of Jesus\\' ministry, Judaism had ceased to be a living faith.\\nJudaism\\'s essence is a restrictive and burdensome legalism.\\nChristianity emphasizes love, while Judaism stands for justice and a God of wrath.\\nJudaism\\'s oppressiveness reflects the disposition of Jesus\\' opponents called \"Pharisees\" (predecessors of the \"rabbis\"), who in their teachings and behavior were hypocrites (see Woes of the Pharisees).\\nCook believes that both contemporary Jews and contemporary Christians need to reexamine the history of early Christianity, and the transformation of Christianity from a Jewish sect consisting of followers of a Jewish Jesus, to a separate religion often dependent on the tolerance of Rome while proselytizing among gentiles loyal to the Roman Empire, to understand how the story of Jesus came to be recast in an anti-Jewish form as the Gospels took their final form.Some scholars say that critical verses in the New Testament have been used to incite prejudice and violence against Jewish people. Professor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of Antisemitism in the New Testament (University Press of America, 1994) has published a study of such verses and the effects that they have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), Hyam Maccoby (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A.

Although some scholars conclude the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel, most scholars agree that all three epistles are written by the same author  or school of thought.With respect to the date and location of authorship of these writings, there is general agreement that all four works probably originated from the same Johannine community. That community is traditionally and plausibly either attributed to Ephesus or Damascus, circa AD 90-110.In the case of Revelation, many modern scholars agree that it was written by a separate author, John of Patmos, c. 95 with some parts possibly dating to Nero\\'s reign in the early 60s.\\n\\n\\n== Early use and attribution of the Johannine works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Attestation ===\\nThe first supposed witness to Johannine theology among the Fathers of the Church is in Ignatius of Antioch, whose Letter to the Philippians some claim references John 3:8 and alludes to John 10:7-9 and John 14:6, but none of these are direct quotations or contain information exclusive to John. Polycarp of Smyrna quotes about the \"antichrist\" in his Epistle to the Phillipians 7:1, a sure reference from the letters of John because the antichrist doctrine is not found in the textual record before the Johannine letters. Justin Martyr also alludes to ideas in John, though this reference is not certain, so the dating of John is not settled.The earliest testimony to the author was that of Papias, preserved in fragmentary quotes in Eusebius\\'s history of the Church. This text is consequently rather obscure. Eusebius says that two different Johns must be distinguished, John the Apostle, and John the Presbyter, with the Gospel assigned to the Apostle and the Book of Revelation to the Presbyter.Irenaeus\\'s witness based on Papias represents the tradition in Ephesus, where John the Apostle is reputed to have lived. Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp, thus in the second generation after the apostle. According to many scholars, he states unequivocally that the apostle is the author of the Gospel. (Other scholars note, however, that Irenaeus consistently refers to the author of the gospel, as well as of Revelation, as \"the disciple of the Lord,\" whereas he refers to the others as \"apostles.\" And so Irenaeus appears to distinguish John, the author of the fourth gospel, from John the Apostle.) Koester rejects the reference of Ignatius of Antioch as referring to the Gospel and cites Irenaeus as the first to use it.For some time it was common practice to assert that the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which contains a small portion of chapter 18 of the Gospel of John, demonstrated that the text of the gospel spread rapidly through Egypt in the second century. However, more recent scholarship has shown the fragment may date from as late as the third or fourth century, rather than the second century, as was previously supposed.Clement of Alexandria mentions John the Apostle\\'s missionary activity in Asia Minor, and continues, \"As for John, the last, upon seeing that in the Gospels they had told the corporal matters, supported by his disciples and inspired by the Holy Spirit, he wrote a spiritual Gospel.\" Origen, when asked how John had placed the cleansing of the Temple first rather than last, responded, \"John does not always tell the truth literally, he always tells the truth spiritually.\" In Alexandria, the authorship of the Gospel and the first epistle was never questioned.

       " Document(page_content='The historical reliability of the Gospels is evaluated by experts who have not found a complete consensus. While all four canonical gospels contain some sayings and events which may meet one or more of the five criteria for historical reliability used in biblical studies, the assessment and evaluation of these elements is a matter of ongoing debate.Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus of Nazareth existed in 1st century Judea (now Israel, and bordering lands), but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus. The only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. There is no scholarly consensus concerning other elements of Jesus\\'s life including the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events such as the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.According to the majority viewpoint, the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, collectively referred to as the Synoptic Gospels, are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus and of the religious movement he founded. The fourth gospel, the Gospel of John, differs greatly from the first three gospels. Historians often study the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles when studying the reliability of the gospels, as Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.\\nAmong scholars, a growing majority considers the Gospels to be in the genre of Ancient Greco-Roman biographies, the same genre as Plutarch\\'s Life of Alexander and Life of Caesar. Typically, ancient biographies written shortly after the death of the subject include substantial history.Historians subject the gospels to critical analysis, attempting to differentiate, rather than authenticate, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations. Scholars use textual criticism to resolve questions arising from textual variations among the numerous manuscripts that have been discovered to decide the most reliable wording of a text as close to what the \"original\" may have looked like. Scholars seek to answer questions of authorship, date and purpose of composition, and look at internal and external sources to determine the degree of reliability of the gospel traditions. Historical reliability is not dependent on a source being inerrant or void of agendas since there are sources that are considered generally reliable despite having such traits (e.g. Josephus).\\n\\n\\n== Methodology ==\\nIn evaluating the historical reliability of the Gospels, scholars consider authorship and date of composition, intention and genre, gospel sources and oral tradition, textual criticism, and historical authenticity of specific sayings and narrative events.\\n\\n\\n=== Scope and genre ===\\n\"Gospels\" is the standard term for the four New Testament books carrying the names of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, each telling of the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth (including his dealings with John the Baptist, his trial and execution, the discovery of his empty tomb, and, at least for three of them, his appearances to his disciples following his death).The genre of the gospels is essential in understanding the intentions of the authors regarding the historical value of the texts.  New Testament scholar Graham Stanton states that \"the gospels are now widely considered to be a sub-set of the broad ancient literary genre of biographies.\" Charles H. Talbert agrees that the gospels should be grouped with the Graeco-Roman biographies, but adds that such biographies included an element of mythology, and that the synoptic gospels also included elements of mythology. E.P. Sanders states that \"these Gospels were written with the intention of glorifying Jesus and are not strictly biographical in nature.\" Ingrid Maisch and Anton Vögtle writing for Karl Rahner in his encyclopedia of theological term', metadata={'title': 'Historical reliability of the Gospels', 'summary': 'The historical reliability of the Gospels is evaluated by experts who have not found a complete consensus. While all four canonical gospels contain some sayings and events which may meet one or more of the five criteria for historical reliability used in biblical studies, the assessment and evaluation of these elements is a matter of ongoing debate.Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus of Nazareth existed in 1st century Judea (now Israel, and bordering lands), but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus. The only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. There is no scholarly consensus concerning other elements of Jesus\\'s life including the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events such as the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.According to the majority viewpoint, the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, collectively referred to as the Synoptic Gospels, are the primary sources of historical information about Jesus and of the religious movement he founded. The fourth gospel, the Gospel of John, differs greatly from the first three gospels. Historians often study the historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles when studying the reliability of the gospels, as Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the Gospel of Luke.\\nAmong scholars, a growing majority considers the Gospels to be in the genre of Ancient Greco-Roman biographies, the same genre as Plutarch\\'s Life of Alexander and Life of Caesar. Typically, ancient biographies written shortly after the death of the subject include substantial history.Historians subject the gospels to critical analysis, attempting to differentiate, rather than authenticate, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations. Scholars use textual criticism to resolve questions arising from textual variations among the numerous manuscripts that have been discovered to decide the most reliable wording of a text as close to what the \"original\" may have looked like. Scholars seek to answer questions of authorship, date and purpose of composition, and look at internal and external sources to determine the degree of reliability of the gospel traditions.

       " Document(page_content='The Gospel of Peter (Ancient Greek: τὸ κατὰ Πέτρον εὐαγγέλιον, romanized: tò katà Pétron euangélion), or the Gospel according to Peter, is an ancient text concerning Jesus Christ, only partially known today. Originally written in Koine Greek, it is considered a non-canonical gospel and was rejected as apocryphal by the Church\\'s synods of Carthage and Rome, which established the New Testament canon. It was the first of the non-canonical gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt.\\nA major focus of the surviving fragment of the Gospel of Peter is the passion narrative, which ascribes responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus to Herod Antipas rather than to Pontius Pilate.\\n\\n\\n== Composition ==\\n\\n\\n=== Authorship ===\\nThe Gospel of Peter explicitly claims to be the work of Saint Peter:\\n\\nAnd I with my companions was grieved; and being wounded in mind we hid ourselves:\\nBut I Simon Peter and Andrew my brother took our nets and went to the sea;\\nAccording to bible scholar Craig Blomberg, the Gospel of Peter is pseudepigraphical (bearing the name of an author who did not actually compose the text).The true author of the gospel remains a mystery. Although there are parallels with the three Synoptic Gospels, Peter does not use any of the material unique to Matthew or unique to Luke. Raymond E. Brown and others find that the author may have been acquainted with the synoptic gospels and even with the Gospel of John; Brown even suggests that the author\\'s source in the canonical gospels was transmitted orally, through readings in the churches, i.e. that the text is based on what the author remembers about the other gospels, together with their own embellishments.Ron Cameron and others have further speculated the Gospel of Peter was written independently of the synoptic gospels using an early proto-gospel. A consequence of this is the potential existence of a source text that formed the basis of the passion narratives in Matthew, Luke, and Mark, as well as in Peter. Origen makes mention of the Gospel of Peter as agreeing with the tradition of the Hebrews. The relationship to the Gospel according to the Hebrews becomes more clear when Theodoret states that the Nazarenes made use of the Gospel of Peter, for it is known by the testimony of the Fathers generally that the Nazarene Gospel was commonly called the Gospel according to the Hebrews. The same Gospel was in use among the Ebionites, and, in fact, as almost all critics are agreed, the Gospel according to the Hebrews – under various names such as the Gospel according to Peter, according to the Apostles, the Nazarenes, Ebionites, Egyptians, etc. – was substantially the same work, circulated very widely throughout the early Church, though with modifications.\\n\\n\\n=== Date ===\\nThe gospel is widely thought to date from after the composition of the four canonical gospels. Scholars are divided as to the exact date of the text, with some placing it in the first half of the 2nd century and considering it to have been compiled based on oral traditions about Jesus, independent of the canonical gospels. The dating of the text depends to a certain extent on whether the text condemned by Serapion, Bishop of Antioch upon inspection at Rhossus is the same as the text that was discovered in modern times. The Rhossus community had already been using it in their liturgy.John Dominic Crossan argues that the Gospel of Peter, as it is found in the modern day, was composed in the 2nd century but incorporates a passion narrative source that predates all other known passion accounts. He calls this primitive passion source the \"Cross Gospel.\" Crossan asserts that this Cross Gospel was written before the synoptic gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke and that it influenced both them and the Gospel of Peter. Crossan\\'s view is not accepted by mainstream Biblical scholars.Craig A. Evans argues that the Gospel of Peter was written in the 2nd century CE to counter anti-Christian polemics of that time (such as t', metadata={'title': 'Gospel of Peter', 'summary': \"The Gospel of Peter (Ancient Greek: τὸ κατὰ Πέτρον εὐαγγέλιον, romanized: tò katà Pétron euangélion), or the Gospel according to Peter, is an ancient text concerning Jesus Christ, only partially known today.

Both the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hanged between two convicts. According to some translations of the original Greek, the convicts may have been bandits or Jewish rebels. According to the Gospel of Mark, he endured the torment of crucifixion from the third hour (between approximately 9 a.m. and noon), until his death at the ninth hour, corresponding to about 3 p.m. The soldiers affixed a sign above his head stating \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews\" which, according to the Gospel of John, was in three languages (Hebrew, Latin, and Greek), and then divided his garments and cast lots for his seamless robe. According to the Gospel of John, the Roman soldiers did not break  Jesus\\'s legs, as they did to the two crucified convicts (breaking the legs hastened the onset of death), as Jesus was dead already.

The author of the Gospel of John seemed interested in maintaining the internal anonymity of the author\\'s identity, although interpreting the Gospel in the light of the Synoptic Gospels and considering that the author names (and therefore is not claiming to be) Peter, and that James was martyred as early as AD 44, Christian tradition has widely believed that the author was the Apostle John, though modern scholars believe the work to be pseudepigrapha.Christian tradition says that John the Evangelist was John the Apostle. John, Peter and James the Just were the three pillars of the Jerusalem church after Jesus\\' death. He was one of the original twelve apostles and is thought to be the only one to escape martyrdom. It had been believed that he was exiled (around AD 95) to the Aegean island of Patmos, where he wrote the Book of Revelation. However, some attribute the authorship of Revelation to another man, called John the Presbyter, or to other writers of the late first century AD. Bauckham argues that the early Christians identified John the Evangelist with John the Presbyter.\\n\\n\\n== Authorship of the Johannine works ==\\n\\nThe authorship of the Johannine works has been debated by scholars since at least the 2nd century AD. The main debate centers on who authored the writings, and which of the writings, if any, can be ascribed to a common author.\\nEastern Orthodox tradition attributes all of the Johannine books to John the Apostle.In the 6th century, the Decretum Gelasianum argued that Second and Third Epistle of John have a separate author known as \"John, a priest\" (see John the Presbyter). Historical critics, like H.P.V. Nunn, as well as non-Christians Reza Aslan and Bart Ehrman, reject the view that John the Apostle authored any of these works.\\nMost modern scholars believe that the apostle John wrote none of these works, although some, such as J.A.T. Robinson, F. F. Bruce, Leon Morris, and Martin Hengel, hold the apostle to be behind at least some, in particular the gospel.There may have been a single author for the gospel and the three epistles. Some scholars conclude the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel, although all four works originated from the same community. The gospel and epistles traditionally and plausibly came from Ephesus, c.\\u200990–110, although some scholars argue for an origin in Syria.In the case of the Book Revelation, most modern scholars agree that it was written by a separate author, John of Patmos, c.\\u200995 with some parts possibly dating to Nero\\'s reign in the early 60s.\\n\\n\\n== Feast day ==\\nThe feast day of Saint John in the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Calendar, is on 27 December, the third day of Christmastide.

The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Holy Thursday. The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, also known as \"Holy Communion\" or \"The Lord\\'s Supper\".The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper. The four canonical gospels state that the Last Supper took place in the week of Passover, days after Jesus\\'s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and before Jesus was crucified on Good Friday. During the meal, Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the apostles present, and foretells that before the next morning, Peter will thrice deny knowing him.The three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread, breaks it and gives it to those present, saying \"This is my body given to you\". The Gospel of John tells of Jesus washing the feet of the apostles, giving the new commandment \"to love one another as I have loved you\", and has a detailed farewell discourse by Jesus, calling the apostles who follow his teachings \"friends and not servants\", as he prepares them for his departure.Some scholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharistic traditions.

Evangelical Protestants also use the term \"Lord\\'s Supper\", but most do not use the terms \"Eucharist\" or the word \"Holy\" with the name \"Communion\".The Eastern Orthodox use the term \"Mystical Supper\" which refers both to the biblical event and the act of Eucharistic celebration within liturgy. The Russian Orthodox also use the term \"Secret Supper\" (Church Slavonic: \"Тайная вечеря\", Taynaya vecherya).\\n\\n\\n== Scriptural basis ==\\nThe last meal that Jesus shared with his apostles is described in all four canonical Gospels as having taken place in the week of the Passover. This meal later became known as the Last Supper. The Last Supper was likely a retelling of the events of the last meal of Jesus among the early Christian community, and became a ritual which recounted that meal.Paul\\'s First Epistle to the Corinthians, which was likely written before the Gospels, includes a reference to the Last Supper but emphasizes the theological basis rather than giving a detailed description of the event or its background.\\n\\n\\n=== Background and setting ===\\nThe overall narrative that is shared in all Gospel accounts that leads to the Last Supper is that after the triumphal entry into Jerusalem early in the week, and encounters with various people and the Jewish elders, Jesus and his disciples share a meal towards the end of the week.

When these domains are aligned, they create a magnetic field. \\n\\nWhen you bring a magnet close to a magnetic material, like a piece of iron, the magnetic field from the magnet causes the domains in the material to align in the same direction. This alignment creates a force that attracts the two objects together.\\n\\nSo basically, magnets work by creating a magnetic field that can attract certain materials due to the alignment of particles within the magnet and the material.'"

They were developed by Richard Feynman in the 1940s as a way to calculate the probability amplitude of specific particle interactions.\\n\\nIn quantum field theory, particles are represented as excitations of their respective quantum fields. The interactions between these particles are described by a Lagrangian, which specifies the dynamics of the fields and their interactions.\\n\\nFeynman diagrams represent different possible ways particles can interact and exchange energy and momentum with each other. Each point in a Feynman diagram represents a vertex where particles interact, and each line represents a particle propagating through space and time.\\n\\nThe calculations of particle interactions using Feynman diagrams involve summing over all possible diagrams that contribute to the process of interest. Each diagram has a corresponding mathematical expression that takes into account the initial and final states of the particles involved, as well as the interactions at each vertex.\\n\\nBy calculating the probability amplitudes associated with each Feynman diagram and summing them up, physicists can determine the probability of a particular particle interaction occurring. Feynman diagrams have been crucial in making predictions and understanding particle interactions in quantum field theory, and they continue to be a powerful tool in theoretical physics.'"

      " the most famous verse in the entire Bible.  John 1:1, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This is the declaration of Jesus Christ as the eternal, divine Word of God.  John then goes on to say in verse 14, “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Word becoming flesh, or the Incarnation, is a central theme in the gospel of John.  This is why John spends time recounting the signs and works Jesus performed while he was here on earth.  This is why John uses the phrase, “and we have seen his glory,” three times in this chapter (1:14, 1:16, 1:18).  John wants us to know that we have seen the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gospel of John is written to help us understand who Jesus is and what he came to do.  John wants us to know that Jesus is the Word of God, the eternal Son of God, and the one who came to save us from our sins.  John also wants us to know that Jesus is still the same Savior today.  Jesus is not just a historical figure, but the living Word of God who speaks to us today.  He is not just a story, but the one who has the power to save us and give us eternal life.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what does it mean for us today?  It means that we can have confidence in the fact that we have the Word of God living among us in the person of Jesus Christ.  It means that we can trust in him to speak truth to us and to guide us in our lives.  It means that we can look to him for salvation and for the strength to live out our faith.  It means that we can have hope in the face of uncertainty and fear.  It means that we can have joy and peace knowing that we have the Word of Life dwelling in us through the Holy Spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we read the gospel of John, let us remember that we have seen the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  Let us trust in him as our Savior and Lord.  Let us listen to his voice and follow him.  Let us be\n"

Again it seems\\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\\narrivals figures.\\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\\nper tonne FOB.\\n    Routine sales of butter were made.

Again it seems\\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\\narrivals figures.\\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\\nper tonne FOB.\\n    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\\n4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\\n    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\\nat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\\n2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\\n2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\\n    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\\nUruguay and open ports.\\n    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\\nMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\\nNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.\\n    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\\ncurrency areas.\\n    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\\nand 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\\nYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\\nSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\\nsaid.\\n    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\\nagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\\ncrop.\\n    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\\nbe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\\ncarnival which ends midday on February 27.\\n Reuter\\n\\x03'"
