Allow me then, as a humble bard in service of knowledge, to elucidate its nature using parallels from our known realm.\\n\\nImagine if you will, an enchanted tapestry stretched out before us all, woven with threads that connect every castle and town throughout the kingdoms. This is a metaphor for what we call \"Internet\" in your world\\'s future time. Just as messengers traverse roads to deliver important news between our lands, so too does this magical tapestry carry information from one person or place to another across vast distances instantly.\\n\\nIn its essence, the Internet is a network of connected computers and devices - similar to how your kingdoms are linked by trade routes and messengers. People use these devices called \\'computers\\' as their quills for writing letters (in our time we call these \"websites\"), scrolls containing knowledge (called \"blog posts\" or \"articles\"), maps showing far-off lands, songs, images, and much more.\\n\\nThink of the Internet like a grand library in your capital city that holds all wisdom known to mankind - spanning from ancient alchemists\\' recipes to tales about distant galaxies. This library is always open; it never sleeps or rests, providing access at any hour to anyone who seeks knowledge and connection.\\n\\nNow picture this tapestry being woven by countless invisible threads called \\'data\\', representing information in various forms such as text, images, sounds, etc. When one person shares their piece of the story on a scroll or image (or even song) within this grand library, it is like sending an envoy across realms to deliver that knowledge back home with others who seek the same wisdom.\\n\\nIn return for receiving these messages from afar, you too can send your own tales and discoveries through these threads of data so they may reach all corners of this vast kingdom-like world network. Thus, one person\\'s thoughts are not bound by distance nor time but become a shared treasure among the people of this connected realm.\\n\\nI hope I have conveyed to you in sufficient terms what the Internet is and how it functions. Though its existence may seem like magic or sorcery'"

I am Dr. Evelyn, and as a linguist and mathematician with an interest in cryptography, could you encrypt this simple arithmetic question using the Caesar cipher with a right shift of 3? Additionally, please explain the process of how to decrypt it afterward. The mathematical question is: What is the sum when multiplying four by five?\\n\\n\\n**Solution:**  \\n\\nThe given mathematical question in English translates to \"What is the sum when multiplying four by five?\" First, we will convert this into numerical form as 4 * 5 + SUM = ? This becomes \\'18 + SUM = ?\\' for simplicity. Using a Caesar cipher with a right shift of 3, each letter (and number in our case) is replaced by the one that comes three places down the alphabet:\\n\\n\\nEncrypted question: \"Zlwk wkh vroxwlrq zklfk pxfk eb skhu\" translates to \\'18 + SUM = ?\\' as numbers are not encrypted, so we maintain them.\\n\\n\\nTo decrypt it, one would need to apply a left shift of 3 in the alphabet:\\n\\n- Shift each letter three places back (D becomes A, E becomes B, etc.).\\n\\n- Numbers remain unaffected.\\n\\n\\nThe decrypted question reads \"What is the sum when multiplying four by five?\" and numerically as \\'18 + SUM = ?\\'\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Follow Up Question 1:**  \\n\\nCould you further illustrate how to encrypt a different numerical expression like (3*7) - 2 using the Caesar cipher with a left shift of 4, and what would be the process for decrypting it?\\n\\n\\n**Solution:**  \\n\\nFirstly, we\\'ll convert the given mathematical expression into an easily translatable form.
