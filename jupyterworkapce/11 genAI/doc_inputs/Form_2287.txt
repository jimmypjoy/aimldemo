TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
 
 
In consideration of the above, the mutual agreements set forth below, and for other good and 
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as 
follows: 
 
1. 
Amount of Third Party Loan.   The Third Party Lender represents that the Third Party Loan is fully 
advanced; does not exceed the amount stated in the Authorization; and, will not exceed the amount allowed 
by the Authorization, plus reasonable costs of collection, maintenance, and protection of the Third Party 
Lender Lien. Any amounts owed by Borrower to Lender in excess of the Third Party Lender Lien amount 
stated in the Authorization cannot be secured by a lien on the Common Collateral unless it is subordinate 
to the 504 Loan. 
 
2. 
Subordination of 504 Loan.  CDC agrees to make the 504 Loan to the Borrower, subject to SBA’s 
approval, and accept a junior and subordinate lien position in the Common Collateral upon the conditions that 
Third Party Lender executes this Agreement and disburses the Third Party Loan according to the terms 
represented to CDC and SBA.   
 
3.   
Accurate Information. The Third Party Lender warrants and represents that all information provided 
by the Third Party Lender to CDC, including, without limitation, all information regarding the Borrower’s 
financial condition, is accurate to the best of its knowledge and that Third Party Lender has not withheld any 
material information.  Third Party Lender acknowledges that for purpose of this transaction, CDC is acting on 
behalf of SBA, an agency in the United States Government, except that SBA accepts no liability or 
responsibility for any wrongful act or omission by CDC.  Third Party Lender further acknowledges that any 
false statements to CDC can be considered false statements to the federal government under 18 U.S.C. §1001, 
and may subject the Third Party Lender to criminal penalties, and that CDC and SBA are relying upon the 
information submitted by the Third Party Lender. 
 
4. 
Waiver of Provision Not to Encumber Common Collateral.   Third Party Lender waives its rights to 
enforce, as against CDC and SBA, any provisions in its documents that prohibit Borrower from further 
encumbering the Common Collateral or which restrict Borrower’s ability to assign its lease on, or rents, 
income or profits from, the Common Collateral. 
 
5. 
Compliance with 504 Loan Program Requirements.  Third Party Lender agrees that all documents 
evidencing the Third Party Loan and the Third Party Lender Lien will comply with the 504 Loan Program 
Requirements as established by SBA, including those identified in the following subparagraphs, and, in the 
event one or more of the provisions in such documents do not comply with these 504 Loan Program 
Requirements, Third Party Lender waives any right to enforce such provisions while the 504 Loan has any 
unpaid balance and agrees that it must act in a commercially reasonable manner with regard to any 
enforcement action.   
 
 
a. 
No Open-Ended Features and No Future Advances.  The Third Party Loan must not 
be open-ended.  After completion of the Project, the Third Party Lender may not make future 
advances under the Third Party Loan except for reasonable costs of collection, maintenance, and 
protection of the Third Party Loan and Third Party Lender Lien. 
 
 
b. 
No Early Call or Demand Provisions.   Third Party Lender agrees that  documents 
evidencing the Third Party Loan and the Third Party Lender Lien do not contain an early call feature 
or any provision which allows Third Party Lender  to make demand under the Third Party Lender 
Loan other than when there is a material default under the terms of its Third Party Loan documents,  
which shall include, but not be limited to, failure to make timely payments on the Third Party Loan, 


--- Page 3 ---
 
 
 
 SBA Form 2287 (04-18) 
 
          3 
 Previous Editions Obsolete 
failure to pay taxes when due or violation of  any financial covenants which would cause a prudent 
lender to believe that the  prospect of payment or performance of the Third Party Note is impaired. 
 
 
c. 
No Cross-Collateralization.   Third Party Lender agrees that the Common Collateral 
will only secure its Third Party Loan and the Common Collateral is not currently, and will not be 
used in the future, as security for any other financing provided by Third Party Lender to Borrower 
that purports to be in a superior position to that of the CDC Lien, unless authorized in writing by 
CDC and SBA. 
 
 
d. 
No Cross-Default.   During the term of the 504 Loan, Third Party Lender will not 
exercise any cross-default, "deem at-risk," or any other provisions in documents evidencing the Third 
Party Loan or Third Party Lender Lien which allow Third Party Lender to make demand on the 
Third Party Loan prior to maturity unless the Third Party Loan is in material default.   
 
 
e. 
Maturity and Balloon Payments.   The Third Party Loan must have a term of at 
least 7 years (when the 504 loan is for a term of 10 years), or a term of at least10 years (when the 
504 loan is for 20 or 25 years).  If the Third Party Lender has made more than one loan, then an 
overall loan maturity must be calculated, taking into account the amounts and maturities of each 
loan.  Any balloon payment for the Third Party Loan must be clearly identified and disclosed to 
SBA and approved at application or subsequently approved by SBA. 
 
 
 
f. 
Reasonable Interest Rate.  The Third Party Loan has a reasonable interest rate 
which does not and will not exceed the maximum interest rate for Third Party Loans from 
commercial financial institutions as published periodically by SBA in the Federal Register and in 
effect as of the date of this Agreement.   
 
6. 
Marshaling of Assets.  If the Third Party Lender takes additional collateral as security for the Third 
Party Loan, in the case of liquidation, any proceeds received from such additional collateral, must be applied 
to the Third Party Lender's Loan prior to the proceeds from the liquidation of the Common Collateral held by 
the CDC/SBA and the Third Party Lender.  If the additional collateral no longer exists at the time of 
liquidation, or has insufficient value to justify the cost of collection, then the Third Party Lender is not 
required to liquidate such collateral, provided the Third Party Lender notifies CDC/SBA.   
 
7. 
Notice of Default under the Third Party Loan.   Within thirty (30) days after the expiration of any 
cure period for any continuing material default of the Third Party Loan or Third Party Lender Lien, Third 
Party Lender must provide written notice (referencing SBA’s loan number for the 504 Loan) of the default to 
CDC and SBA.  At least sixty 60 days prior to any legal proceedings against or liquidation of the Common 
Collateral (not including sending a demand letter), Third Party Lender must provide SBA with written notice 
of its intent to do so. 
 
8. 
Limitation on Default Interest Rate.   Third Party Lender may not escalate the rate of interest upon 
default to a rate greater than the maximum rate published by SBA in the Federal Register.  SBA will only pay 
the interest rate on the note in effect before the date of Borrower’s default. 
 
9. 
 Subordination to 504 Loan and/or CDC Lien, of Amounts Attributable to Default  
 
 
Provisions.      
 
 
 
 
 
a. 
The term "Default Charges" used in this paragraph includes, but is not limited to, 
prepayment penalties, late fees, other default charges, and escalated interest after default due under 
the Third Party Loan.

b. 
To the extent the Third Party Lender Lien secures any amounts attributable to 
Default Charges, which may exist in the Third Party Loan and Third Party Lender Lien, Third Party 
Lender Lien is and will be subordinate to the 504 Loan and the CDC Lien. This subordination 
applies only to CDC and SBA and their successors and assigns, and shall not inure to the benefit of 
Borrower or any guarantor of the Third Party Loan. 
 
 
 
c. 
In the event of default under the Third Party Loan, CDC or SBA may bring the 
Third Party Loan current or may acquire the Third Party Loan secured by the Third Party Lender 
Lien.  Third Party Lender agrees that in either of these circumstances, the amount to bring the Third 
Party Loan current or the purchase price of that loan will be net of all amounts attributable to the 
Default Charges so subordinated to the 504 Loan and the CDC Lien.  Third Party Lender further 
agrees that if it receives from CDC or SBA any amounts attributable to such Default Charges, Third 
Party Lender holds such funds in trust for SBA and will remit such funds to SBA as soon as possible.  
In addition, Third Party Lender shall charge as against SBA only the interest rate on the Third Party 
Loan that was in effect before the date of Borrower’s default.  Should CDC or SBA not purchase the 
Third Party Loan but rather bring the Third Party Loan current, Default Charges on the Third Party 
Loan may remain due and owing from the Borrower.   
 
 
 
d. 
The Third Party Lender agrees: 
 
 
(1) 
If the Third Party Lender sells its Note (other than when liquidating the 
Third Party Loan), then the Third Party Lender must provide CDC/SBA, within fifteen (15) days of 
the sale, with written notice of the purchaser's name, address and telephone number and confirmation 
that the purchaser has received a copy of the executed Third Party Lender Agreement. 
  
 
 
(2) 
If the Third Party Loan is in default and the Third Party Lender, as 
part of its liquidation strategy,  
 
 
 
 
(i)  proposes to sell its note, or  
 
 
 
 
(ii) receives an offer from a third party, then the Third Party Lender must 
provide CDC/SBA with the option to purchase the note at the same price offered by the 
potential purchaser, net any Default Charges per paragraph 9(c).  SBA will have forty-
five (45) days from receipt of the notice from the Third Party Lender to exercise its 
option to purchase the note.  If SBA does not exercise its option and the Third Party 
Lender sells its note, then the Third Party Lender must provide CDC/SBA, within fifteen 
(15) days of the sale, with written notice of the purchaser's name, address and telephone 
number, and must provide the purchaser with a copy of the executed Third Party Lender 
Agreement.   
 
 
 
e. 
If the Third Party Lender sells or otherwise transfers its note to a third party, then 
any Default Charges, including, but not limited to, prepayment penalties, late fees, other Default 
Charges, and escalated interest after default due under the Third Party Loan must be subordinate to 
the amounts outstanding on the 504 Loan and/or CDC Lien. 
 
 
 
 
f. 
If the Third Party Lender loan documents contain a swap component or hedging 
contract (hereinafter defined as “swap agreement), all costs associated with this swap agreement, 
which may be termed swap fees, termination fees, default fees or other related fees, shall be 
subordinate to the amounts outstanding on the 504 Loan and/or CDC Lien.

10.  
 Liquidation.  In the event that either the Third Party Loan or the 504 Loan is declared in default, 
Third Party Lender and CDC and SBA agree to cooperate in liquidating and/or selling the Common 
Collateral. Third Party Lender agrees to (a) accept a U.S. Treasury check(s) in connection with any 
purchase of Third Party Lender’s note or any foreclosure or liquidation bid by CDC or SBA; (b) to 
provide CDC and SBA with the loan payment status, loan payment history, and an itemized payoff 
statement of the Third Party Loan; (c) to provide CDC and SBA, at no charge (except for reasonable 
charges for photocopies) with copies of any appraisals, environmental investigations, or title examinations 
or searches of the Collateral conducted by or for Third Party Lender; and (d) to provide any other 
information about Borrower or the Third Party Loan requested by CDC and SBA in writing.  
 
 11.          Waiver of Right to Indemnification by SBA or CDC.   If Third Party Lender's documents contain 
provisions granting Third Party Lender the right to indemnification by subsequent owners of the Project 
Property, then Third Party Lender waives its right to enforce such provisions against SBA or CDC in the 
event SBA or CDC acquires title to the Project Property through foreclosure of the CDC Lien, acceptance of 
a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise.  
 
Paragraph 12 is optional and should be marked if CDC uses Third Party Lender to perform Customer 
Identification. 
 
12. 
Bank Regulatory Issues.   If Third Party Lender is regulated by one of the Federal functional 
regulators (Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or National Credit 
Union Administration), Third Party Lender represents that it is subject to the Joint Final Rule on 
Customer Identification Programs (CIP) in 31 C.F.R. 103.121 and that it or its agent will perform with 
respect to the Borrower the specified requirements of its CIP. 
 
13. 
No Implied Third Party Beneficiaries.      To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement 
and any provision in any agreement either Party may have with a third party, including but not limited to, 
Borrower, the terms and conditions in this Agreement shall supersede any such provision.  The parties agree 
that SBA may enforce this agreement as a third party beneficiary, and further  agree  that this Agreement 
shall not grant any right, benefit, priority, or interest to any other third party, including but not limited to, 
Borrower and Guarantor(s). 
 
14 
Successors and Assigns.     This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and bind the respective parties 
to this Agreement, and their successors and assigns, including any party acquiring the Third Party Loan and 
Third Party Lender Lien by sale, assignment, or other transfer from Third Party Lender.   Third Party Lender 
agrees that CDC may assign this Agreement to SBA, and waives all rights to contest such assignment.  
 
15. 
Federal Law. 
When SBA is the holder of the loan instruments evidencing the 504 Loan and any 
security for that loan (including but not limited to the CDC Lien on the Common Collateral), this Agreement 
and all such instruments will be construed in accordance with Federal law.  CDC or SBA may use local or 
state procedures for purposes such as filing papers, recording documents, giving notice, foreclosing liens, and 
other purposes, but by using these procedures, SBA does not waive any federal immunity from local or state 
control, penalty, tax, or liability.  The Third Party Lender may not claim or assert against SBA any local or 
state law to deny any obligation of Borrower, or defeat any claim of SBA with respect to the 504 Loan.  
 
16. 
Termination:  This document will be released and terminated upon the payment in full of either the 
Third Party Loan or the 504 loan and all costs related thereto.    
 
17. 
Counterparts.      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will 
be deemed an original, and all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.

18. 
Validity of Provisions.      In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable.  
 
19. 
Revision of this Agreement.      Both Third Party Lender and CDC agree that this Agreement is a 
standard SBA Form, and, as such, neither party has authority to modify or delete any provision in this 
Agreement, or add any additional provisions, without prior written authorization from the SBA.
