But analysts say the bullish trend probably will not\nlast. Tight restrictions on foreign ownership of shares have\nheld back development on the market, they say. While some of\nthese rules could soon be eased, Norway's unresolved economic\nwoes mean the prices boom is likely to be short-lived.\n    Last Thursday, the all-share index reached 325.48 points to\nbeat the previous record of 325.31 set in mid-November, 1985.\n    Brokers say the new record, spurred by firmer oil prices\nabove 18 dlrs a barrel which are crucial to Norway's economy,\nhas for now set the Oslo bourse apart from the current\nfluctuations on other world stock markets.\n    \"It's an underdeveloped market...Virgin territory ,\" Jenny\nTora, a Scandinavian securities analyst with London-based\nstockbrokers James Capel, told Reuters.\n    But the attraction for foreign investors of the stock\nmarket, where price/earnings ratios average around a relatively\nlow 11, is tempered by restrictions and some nervousness about\nthe future of Norway's economy, analysts say.\n    Foreign ownerhsip is limited in all sectors and varies\nbetween 10 and 40 pct of the shares of any company - and the\nclass of shares rarely carry voting rights.\n    \"It's often hard to get stocks as the quotas are full,\" Tora\nsaid. \"There can be problems of liquidity in the market.

The current account balance of payments\ndeficit stood at 32.8 billion crowns last year, against a\nsurplus of 26.8 billion crowns in 1985.\n    \"I'd be very cautious about present stock levels,\" Chris\nHonnor of London-based brokers Grieveson Grant said.\n    The record-breaking performance last Thursday meant that\nthe all-share index had increased by 16 pct from the start of\n1987.\n    On Friday the index leapt another 7.78 points to 333.26.\nBut analysts noted this was largely due to much better than\nexpected profits in the first quarter from Norsk Hydro,\nNorway's largest diversified corporation.\n    Foreign investors, spurred by the appreciating crown and\nthe rise in oil prices, have been more prominent in the market\nthis year, although they still trade selectively mainly in\nNorsk Hydro, Norsk Data and a few other top-traded industrials.\n    Earlier this month the government proposed allowing the\nshare of foreign ownerhsip permitted in financial institutions\nto rise in a bid to boost competition.

This is not just a currency\nproblem.

It would have done\nthe trick then,\" said one currency analyst.\n    \"If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure\nnot an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not\nstrength,\" added one trader.\n    In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise\nmight place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and\ntempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate.\n    A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the\nprotectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected\nto pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises\nPresident Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with\nduring their summit later in the week.\n    \"Politically, they can't really do it this week,\" said one\ncurrency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize\nthe dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance.\n    Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and\ntraders do not hold out high hopes for any major new\ninitiatives from this week's talks.\n    At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan\nwill agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to\noutsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and\nsupport the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement.\n    But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the\nmarket's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears\nof weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S.\nTreasury refunding program.\n    Japanese and European investors have traditionally played\nan active role in these auctions, which are expected to total\n28 to 29 billion dlrs.\n    Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that\nPresident Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries\nabout currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget\ndeficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars.\n    While similar action by former President Carter helped to\nstabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly\nreluctant to take such a step, economists said.\n    This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S.\nTreasury Secretary James Baker said, \"there might well be some\nwho would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence\nby the U.S. in its own currency.\"\n    Baker added, \"therefore we don't think it's an appropriate\nthing to do.\"\n    A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here\nshared Baker's doubts. \"Dollar defending measures are very\nunlikely.

{"title": "U.S. BEEF, CITRUS TALKS WITH JAPAN SEEN TOUGH", "body": "The Reagan administration is expected to\nface tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S.\ninterests, if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef\nand citrus import controls by April, 1988, U.S. and Japanese\nofficials said.\n    Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative\nClayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in\ntalks here last week, insisting that the quotas be abandoned by\nApril, 1988.\n    But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan\nwill resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S.\nsuppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining\nthe quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters.\n    Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated with\nJapan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo\nround of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and in\nbilateral talks in 1984.\n    Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at the\noutset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead.\nThe current agreement calls for an increase in high quality\nbeef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to\n126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes.\n    Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States\nwill not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan has\nbeen given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support\nsystem and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said.\n    Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and\ncitrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said.\n    If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan,\nas expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put to\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement,\nwhich would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988\ndeadline set by the U.S., officials said.\n    In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beef\nthey will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S.\npressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive\nand would be damaged by freer trade.\n    Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small\nfarms which Japanese officials said must be protected from\ncheap imports by use of the quota system.\n    Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen's\nAssociation is strongly supporting the tough administration\nposition, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent.\n    This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef\nexports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliable\nbusiness managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry\nPromotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's\nbeef market has expanded at the expense of Australia.\n    In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concerned\nthe U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would\nbecome a riskier business, meat industry sources said.\n    Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington\nnext week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in an\neffort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan.\n    The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue.\nCalifornia's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to\nJapan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas.\n    A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is\nconcerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality oranges\nfrom Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan.\n    Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that fresh\noranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a\nminimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production.\n    This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with\nsmaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants to\nmaintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice\ntastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange\njuice, they said.\n    One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officials\nis that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance\nby offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for\nU.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas.\n    Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and\ncitrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted during\nthe week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the\nU.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice\nissue which received most of the attention.\n    Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness,\nLyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese side\nhave benefited from quotas but this will not stop the\nadministration from pressing for liberalization.\n    And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall\nmore support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before,\nbecause of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus.\n    \"We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation)\nwith a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The times\nhave changed. The trade balance is much worse,\" Lyng said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "U.S. MAY HAVE TO ACT TO SUPPORT DOLLAR", "body": "The prospect of renewed assaults on\nthe dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil\ndistasteful measures to bolster support for its currency,\nmonetary analysts and economists said.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the\nReagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing\nyen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar.\n    But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to\ntake such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources say\nthe issue has been seriously discussed by the administration.\n    \"It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,\"\nBaker said last week. \"In our view there might well be some who\nwould view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack of\nconfidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we\ndon't think it's an appropriate thing to do.\"\n    But if the Reagan administration did announce measures,\nthey could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort\nto end the instability in financial markets with genuine action\nto reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analysts\nbelieve.\n    And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter\nadministration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a\nrise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct.\n    The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key\nrate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it could\nhurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile\ninternational debt situation.\n    Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided\nover its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement\ncould come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese\nPrime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.\n    \"It would give some real focus to the visit, and it might\nsteady the dollar and prevent it from going down,\" said Charles\nTaylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.\n    But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the\nReagan administration would resort to measures which would\nbring to mind the troubles of President Carter.\n    Until very recently, the current administration has urged a\nlower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while\nCarter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic\npolicies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies are\nincreasingly in question.\n    The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was a\nresounding success. \"This package really gave credibility to the\nadministration to get the dollar up,\" said Robert Hormats,\nvice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S.\neconomic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations.\n    The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around\n188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen.\n    \"The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is\nevidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really\ndoing very little,\" Hormats said of statements to support the\ndollar by U.S. officials.\n    Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials\nthink these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying\nthe dollar has declined far enough.\n    Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc\nbonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support\nfor the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, who\nhad lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes.\n    The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount\nrate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the\nInternational Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to\nother IMF members. \n    It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines\nwith other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold\nsales.\n    Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is now\nvice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, \"I think it's very\nunlikely they would do that now.\"\n    He argued that it was politically difficult to take action\nto support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still\nto fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies.\n    But most analysts believe a currency support package would\nonly work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade\nimbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers.\n    It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of\nthe seven major industrial democracies -- the United States,\nJapan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n    Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline\nslightly further for a package to have impact. He said the\nseven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged\ntoo soon to fundamentally change market sentiment.\n    \"I think we're nearing a point when they would feel\n(politically) comfortable doing this,\" Hormats said.\n    Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act\nfirmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the\npressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear\nof fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress.\n    But Hormats said \"there will be a point at which the\ngovernment of the United States shows it does give a damn for\nthe dollar.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Undiscovered resources are\nestimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of the\ntotal ultimate reserves, Semenovich said.\n    \"There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world\nand, as far as the already known basins, one continues to find\nadditional reserves,\" he said, noting that Antarctica has been\nvirtually ignored. \"The existing estimate of potential\nresources of the world may need to be enlarged.\"\n    To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists will\nneed to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laser\nspectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other\ntechniques, he said.\n    He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13\npct of all offshore reserves.\n    Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil\nand gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be\ndiscovered and placed in production during the next 50 years.\n    After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil\nproduction was increasing. \"The difficulties of 1985 have been\novercome and we're now back to normal production,\" he said.\n    The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, had\nexperienced drilling and technical problems that cut total\nliquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1\nmln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced an\nestimated 12.3 mln barrels.\n    When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal\ngasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said\nthe project was important because of the lack of oil reserves\nin the region.\n    Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil\nprices the coal gasification process would become economic\nagain. \"It's too expensive for the time being,\" Semenovich\nsaid.\n    \"Theoretical development is underway and tests are being\nrun. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part of\nthe energy industry,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

That\nshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,\nthey said.\n    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest\nrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to\nspeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.\n    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the\nDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the\nBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.\n    \"I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little\nit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,\" he said. But a\nsharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the\nBundesbank to take some action, he said.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in\ninterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.\n    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the\nmonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather\nthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response\nto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make\nthe mark and mark investments less attractive.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors\nwould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which\nhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which\nwould take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.\n    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead\ninvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next\nmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying\nbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.\n    There are so far no signs that German investors are\nswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank\nhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank\neconomist Hermann Remsperger said.\n    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates\nand a strong currency would attract foreign investors into\nGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.\n    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland\nin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would\ncontinue to drift lower in many European countries.\n    \"The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain\nbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see some\nconsolidation,\" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match\nany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further\nagainst the mark, he said.\n    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in\nU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the\npound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

But as oil prices increase the long-term\neconomic outlook is favorable, oil industry experts said.\n    \"Estimated potential world reserves of extra heavy oils\nexceed 500 billion barrels, of which more than half are located\nin Venezuela,\" Juan Chacin Guzman, President of Petroleos de\nVenezuela told the World Petroleum Congress.\n    \"And this virtually unused resource represents a prime\nexample of the need to invest in technology to ensure\ntomorrow's energy future,\" he added.\n    Venezuela had to reduce heavy crude oil output in favor of\nlight oils because of economics and a very limited market. Not\nmany refineries have been upgraded to process the heavy oils.\n    \"Improved technology has the potential for reducing the\ncapital investment and operating costs of typical heavy oil\ndevelopment projects by 30 pct or more,\" Gordon Willmon, VP and\ngeneral manager, oil sands and coal department, Esso Resources\nCanada Ltd said at the World Petroleum Congress.\n    Crude oil prices fell under 10 dlrs dlrs a barrel last\nsummer as OPEC members increased production to gain market\nshare, but have since risen to around 18 dlrs because the  OPEC\nproduction/pricing agreement is basically in tact.\n    Willmon said light and medium crude oils currently supply\n90 pct of world oil demand yet they account for less than 25\npct of remaining petroleum resources.\n    \"So future demand increasingly will be met from the various\nforms of heavy oil,\" Willmon said. Heavy crude oil resources\ninclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and\noil shales (in sedimentary rock).\n     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil\ndevelopment economical, including real and stable growth in\ncrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved\ntechnology.\n    He said he expects \"all pieces of the puzzle to fit\ntogether.\" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very\nsensitive to crude oil prices. And he said the most important\nfactor in development of heavy oils is the recovery of the\nprice of crude.\n    Willmon said the price of light crude must be about eight\ndlrs higher than heavy crude before there is an incentive for\nan oil company to upgrade its refinery to process heavy oil.\n    He said the current price differential is only about five\ndlrs a barrel.\n    Willmon indicated that a benchmark crude oil price above 20\ndlrs would be ideal. But he said currently under study are a\nbroad range of high potential cost-effective technologies for\nresources recovery, transportation and upgrading of heavy oils,\nwhich would permit commercial development despite a lower crude\noil price outlook.\n    Willmon said these technologies included enhanced recovery\nby steam injection and oil-and-water emulsion to reduce the\nviscocity of the heavy oils so they can flow easily through a\npipeline. He said such technologies may substantially reduce\ncurrent captial investment and operating costs.\n    But he emphasized that innovative technology alone may not\nencourage new investment, that oil prices need to show a\nmeaningful and sustained recovery.\n   Most of the expenses associated with heavy oils production\nis fixed operating costs as in an oil sands project, rather\nthan in exploration, according to Robert Smith, Senior VP\nOperations <Syncrude Canada Ltd>.\n    While exploration costs for conventional crude oil range\nfrom four to nine dlrs a barrel, discovery costs for synthetic\ncrude from oil sands are nearly zero because the location and\nnature of the deposit are known, according to Smith.\n    But the remote location of oil sands deposits mean that\neverything required to build and operate the plant must come\nfrom outside the area.\n    Willmon also said, \"Public policy could best help by\nproviding financial support to offset the high cost of\ntechnology developmemt which would help generate projects that\ncould survive even at low oil prices for extended periods of\ntime.\"\n    U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said, \"The Reagan\nAdministration is firmly committed, without equivocation, to\ncontinuing our efforts to improve conditions and incentives in\nthe marketplace that will spur oil and gas exploration and\ndevelopment.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

First quarter natural gas\nconsumption data is not available until June.\n    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand\nfell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not\nable to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.\n    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were\nconcerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital\ninvestment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on\nspot purchases.\n    \"With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural\ngas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,\" he\nsaid, adding that compared with the same period last year,\nJanuary natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for\nindustrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.\n    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas\nto lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.\n    \"March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas\nconsumption not only in home heating but also in electricity\ngeneration,\" he said.\n     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual\nfuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day\nfrom the same period a year ago.\n    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices\nhad put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric\nutilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the\nrole of natural gas was over-stated.\n    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the\nfuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream\nin the last few years.\n    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected\nthe same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. \n    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct\nof the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,\nhe said.

Key bond yields fell to around four\npct from five pct in the same period.\n    \"Variable life avails itself of the times and clients are\nlikely to be attracted after the impressive results to be made\npublic in early June,\" Ichirou Hayashi, general manager of\nNippon Life Insurance Co Ltd's fund management office said.\n    The Finance Ministry does not allow disclosure of insurance\ncompany figures for the year ended March 31 until early June.\n    Nippon Life, the largest Japanese insurer, had about 50,000\ninvestors in variable life by end-March while the three U.S.\nFirms which offer variable life here have a total of some 7,550\ninvestors, fund managers said.\n    Equitable Life Insurance Co Ltd, American Life Insurance Co\nLtd and Sony Prudential Life Insurance Co, which is a joint\nventure between Sony Corp and Prudential Life Assurance of the\nU.S., Are the three U.S. Insurers offering variable life here.\n   \"Although (variable life) appears to be a short-term\nfinancial instrument with death benefit, its first priority is\nto raise as much cash value as it can over the long period,\"\nsaid Ichiro Kono, managing director and chief actuary of Sony\nPrudential. Variable life guarantees a fixed death benefit.\n    \"Variables are also attractive to executives of companies\nwho wish to receive them as retirement funds with options for\nsettlement in annuities,\" Kono said.\n    Nippon Life's Hayashi said sales of variable life were\nshaping up well as interest rate consciousness grows.\n    Insurance managers said they expect variables to survive\nany credit market collapse since the funds should be able to\nreact to interest rate fluctuations more quickly than huge\ngeneral insurance accounts, assuming fund managers grow more\nsophisticated in global fund and risk management.\n    Japanese life insurers have cut dividends paid to holders\nof regular insurance by as much as 0.45 of a percentage point\nsince April 1 due to declining domestic interest rates.\n    Fund managers said regular insurance funds are invested\nmore conservatively with decisions based on long-term\nstrategies. Major life insurers are expected to report huge\nexchange losses, estimated at over 2,000 billion yen, on\nforeign investment for 1986/87, they said.\n    \"Asset mix is more of a concept for larger funds, not for\nour variables, especially after the huge currency losses made\nin the last fiscal year,\" Hayashi of Nippon Life said.\n    Industry analysts said shifts of funds ahead of tax changes\ndue in October are helping boost the demand for variable life.\n    The government is expected to impose a 20 pct withholding\ntax on interest from certain instruments including single\npremium endowment insurance, much of which is maturing now, but\nvariable life will be free of such a tax.\n    But Sony Prudential's Kono said, \"A large shift of funds\nfrom single premium endowment to variable life is unlikely,\nbecause investors in the former are more short-term\nreturn-minded, while the latter doesn't guarantee short-term\ncash value.\"\n    Sony Prudential and Equitable Life each have three separate\nvariable life accounts. Equitable's funds specialise in\nJapanese stocks, U.S. Stocks and money market instruments while\nSony's covers bonds, stocks and general investment.\n    Japanese insurers have only one variable account each.\n    The Finance Ministry allowed sales of variable life\nendowment with terms over 10-years and whole life insurance\nfrom October 1 last year but allowed single premiums only on\nthe latter.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "LATIN DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF", "body": "Rising interest rates and\nprotectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by Latin\nAmerican nations to win debt relief, regional foreign and\nfinance ministry officials said here.\n    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations met\nhere this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to what\nthey called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp's\ndecision to create reserves against third world loans.\n    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)\n    \"We are looking at trade, interest rates and financial\nflows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanent\nsolutions,\" Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.\n    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of Latin\nAmerican presidents and debate on new solutions.\n    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, and\nproposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed in\na letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to\nattend a summit in Venice this month.\n    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,\nbut Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.\n    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister\nand Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's\ndecision could discourage new lending. But it might help\nCartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.\n    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level\nfor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt\ncrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. It\nwould pay new loans at current market rates.\n    \"Many countries fear that what they have gained in months of\narduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a one\npoint rise in interest rates,\" one official here said.\n    \"The new increase in interest rates has come precisely when\nwe thought they had still not come down enough,\" Iglesias said.\n    Latin American officials are also concerned that varying\ninterest spreads granted to different debtor nations could\ngenerate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest at\nbeing given less favourable terms than Argentina.\n    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut in\nits 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcano\nsaid here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.\n    This week's meeting came after three Latin American\npresidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interest\nrates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It was\ncalled to review developments since the last ministerial\nmeeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.\n    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some\nadvances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan\nand refinancing package agreed last September. But there have\nalso been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.\n    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materialized\nand debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.\n    \"We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to its\nlimits and and the question is now where do we go from here?\" a\nsenior Mexican foreign ministry official said.\n    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtor\neconomies back to a position where they can again service their\ndebts and qualify for new loans.\n    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin American\ndebtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, with\nthe exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying back\nprincipal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their\ndebts in the foreseeable future.\n    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion\ndlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.\n    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would\nprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the\nsecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But\nthey said it might make new lending even more remote.\n    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through\ndebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor\neconomies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this\nfield, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as\nlimited and no panacea for the overall problem.\n    Most Latin officials set greater store on building up\nexport income than on debt-equity schemes.\n    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's\ndebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion\nlast year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratio\nhardly changed.\n    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link to\nbe recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.\n    Officials said initiatives discussed here would be\nsubmitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,\nbefore IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pct\nof Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for more\nthan 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.\n    Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateral\nagencies.\n    Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord a\nsecond time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore it\ncredit rating and raise new loans.\n    He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without a\ngovernment guarantee, something that Argentina and others are\njust starting to try to negotiate in their restructuring\npackages.\n    Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and West\nGermany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.\n    According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mln\nmark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.\n    Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned\n100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks were\ncontinuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.\n    Banking sources said one option was to privately place the\nbonds through the Caracas-based Banco de Venezuela, which would\nunderwrite the issue, but Marcano said no decision has yet been\nmade.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Sales fell 1.9 pct to 3,308\nbillion yen, the first year-on-year sales drop in 21 years.\n    Iemura said the results reflected trade friction over\nsemiconductor exports to the U.S., The yen's sharp rise against\nthe dollar and a drop in exports to China.\n    The 1986/87 foreign exchange loss totalled 145 billion yen,\nincluding parent company losses of 120 billion.\n    The average value of the yen against the dollar rose to 161\nfrom 221 a year earlier, he added.\n    Weaker prices for semiconductors and office automation\nequipment cut total sales 245 billion yen, Iemura said.\n    Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices,\naccounting for 36 pct of the total, rose five pct to 1,183\nbillion yen in 1987/88 from a year earlier, helped by good\nsales of word processors, workstations, medical equipment,\npoint-of-sales systems and exports of personal computers.\n    Semiconductor sales rose to 410 billion yen from 360\nbillion a year earlier but fell short of an expected 430\nbillion.

H.C.F. Porsche AG <PSHG.F>\nto continue its slide because of the weak U.S. Dollar.\n    They were generally optimistic for Bayerische Motoren Werke\nAG <BMWG.F> (BMW) but some were sceptical it could match record\n1986 profits. Views were mixed on Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, but\nsome analysts took comfort from the fact that Europe's leading\ncar maker had apparently put a major currency scandal behind\nit.\n    VW could be vulnerable as Japanese exporters, suffering\nfrom the strength of the yen against the dollar, switched their\nsales offensive from the U.S. To Europe, they said.\n    Analyst Joseph Rooney with brokers James Capel in London,\nnoted the Japanese drive was coming at a time when the whole\nEuropean market was expected to contract slightly.\n    But analysts saw most German manufacturers meeting the\nchallenge, even though the Japanese were now starting to focus\non the up-market sector.\n    BMW's chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim shrugged off the\nJapanese drive in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazine.\"I\nview the move by the Japanese into the top class with a certain\nequanimity. Not only are we playing on home turf, we also have\ntechnical superiority,\" he said.\n    The car industry benefitted last year from clarification of\ndomestic rules on low-pollution cars, which meant orders put\noff in 1985 were carried out the following year. Tax cuts\ngenerally boosted domestic demand, especially for cars.\n    Domestic registrations leapt by nearly 19 pct to a record\n2.8 mln cars. The VDA industry association says this might ease\nto 2.7 mln in 1987, but predicts another good year.\n    Looking to the future, Daimler has designated 16 billion\nmarks for car sector spending in the next five years. Chairman\nWerner Breitschwerdt says spending is not aimed at quantity but\nimproving high quality technology and accessories.\n    Analyst Stephen Reitman with Phillips and Drew in London,\nsaid Daimler had the best earnings profile of West German\nproducers, with group profits per share rising to 80 marks from\n78.8 in 1986.\n    Analysts were more cautious about VW. Reinhard Fischer with\nBank in Liechtenstein (BiL) in Frankfurt saw VW's group\nearnings per share falling to 35 marks in 1987 from 42 in 1986.\nA recent report from his bank said last year's currency losses\nwere a sign of mismanagement.\n    It stressed heavy losses from VW's Brazilian operations and\nits Spanish unit, SEAT.\n    VW's first quarter figures also highlighted problems in\nboth the U.S. And Brazil, analysts said.\n    VW reported flat first quarter earnings, except for a 39.2\npct fall in U.S. Sales and Brazilian sales which dived 46.5\npct.\n    Reitman was more optimistic than BiL about VW's 1987 group\nearnings and, predicting an improvement in both Spain and\nBrazil, he saw an unchanged 42 marks per share, ,\n    He also said that VW now stood to benefit from not hedging\nagainst foreign exchange fluctuations.\n    In a May 1 study, he wrote: \"One point in VW's favour is\nthat its extraordinary policy of not hedging forward has meant\nthat it will have less far to go in adjusting to current\nDM/Dollar rates than the other German manufacturers who were to\na lesser or greater extent protected up to 1986.\"\n    Reitman was also reassured by the apparent end of the\ncurrency scandal, where allegedly faked forward contracts were\nnot acknowledged by VW's banks. VW fixed final losses from the\nfraud at 473 mln marks for which provisions were made in 1986.\n    VW's new Audi 80, a sporty model which German media reports\nsay was designed to jazz up Audi's staid \"Grandpa\" image,\ncontributed significantly to VW's first quarter performance.\nThe 80 doubled its sales against the year-ago level.\n    But the Audi range as a whole has suffered a huge setback\nin the U.S. Because of an image problem linked to claims of\n\"unintentional acceleration.\"\n    Von Kuenheim won't be pinned down on BMW's 1987 profits,\nbut at a news conference he emphasised 1986 earnings were a\nrecord high. Without referring to 1987, he added: \"If profits\nare less in one year or the other they will still be good.\"\n    Rooney said group profits per share, which BMW does not\npublish, would rise to 62.5 marks this year. Some analysts put\nthe 1986 group profit at 60 marks, a figure BMW does not deny.\n    But Reitman was more pessimistic, predicting 50 marks per\nshare in 1987, and a return to 60 next year. He said: \"BMW will\nbe the story of 1988,\" when it plans to launch an updated\nversion of its Five series.\n    BMW also has a big investment programme under way and Bil's\nFischer said depreciations could affect earnings. Other\nanalysts pointed to possible hedging problems and Reitman noted\na 2.10 marks to the dollar hedge expired this September.\n    Reitman said the outlook for Porsche was bearish for the\nyear to end-July, 1987. Porsche's 1985/86 group profits at 84\nmarks per share fell 30 pct from the record 120 marks in\n1984/85 and Reitman saw 60 marks in 1986/87.\n    \"With the U.S. Currently accounting for 63 pct of unit sales\n(this is expected to fall to 60 pct in the full year 1986/87)\nPorsche's earnings remain uncomfortably exposed to the\nDM/dollar relationship,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

But\nthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\nsides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\n    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\nthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\ndangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\n    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\nmillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\napply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\ncake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\n    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\nis not properly dried or ground.\n    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\nLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\nstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\nbut this was likely to take several years of research.\n    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\ncoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\n    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\ndepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\navoiding the copra process altogether.\n    \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\ncopra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying\nthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\ncoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\nthe chemical root.\"\n    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\nbecome more protectionist and he expected export prices of\ncoconut products to drop.\n    \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\nand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he\nsaid.\n    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\nproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\noutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\n    \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\nbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\nsaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"\nhe said.\n    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\nstay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\nhigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\nand a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\n    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\ncoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\nafter two successive years of good harvests.\n    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\nadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.\n    \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\nprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\nprices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.\n    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\nplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\n    \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\n10,000 square metres of land.

New debt offerings rose to nearly 2.8 billion dlrs\nduring the holiday-shortened week from 2.09 billion dlrs in the\nprevious week, they calculated.\n    \"And most of (last week's) issues were not even on the\ncalendar,\" an underwriter remarked.\n    Analysts noted that in the past few months the fixed-income\nmarkets became virtually obsessed with the dollar. The\ncurrency's sharp drop ignited fears that foreign investors\nwould shun dollar-denominated debt vehicles.\n    Also, many participants believed inflation would gather\nmomentum because of the dollar's fall. Inflation is the number\none enemy of fixed-rate investments, analysts explained.\n    But the dollar's recovery last week calmed worries in the\nTreasury and corporate bond markets over foreign investor\ndemand and inflation. The resulting decline in yields should\nbring company treasurers to market, traders said.\n    Underwriters are slated to bid competitively tomorrow for\n250 mln dlrs of first mortgage bonds due 2017 of Georgia Power\nCo, a unit of Southern Co <SO>. The issue is rated Baa-1 by\nMoody's Investors and BBB-plus by Standard and Poor's.\n    This would be Georgia Power's first bond issue in the U.S.\nsince August 1986 when it sold 250 mln dlrs of same-rated,\nsame-maturity 10 pct bonds yielding 250 basis points more than\ncomparable Treasury securities.\n    Tomorrow will see another competitive. Syndicates will bid\nfor 100 mln dlrs of 30-year bonds rated A-1/A-plus of Virginia\nElectric and Power Co, a unit of Dominion Resources Inc <D>.\n    Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market in\nOctober 1986 when the utility issued 100 mln dlrs of\nsame-rated, same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. The bonds were\npriced to yield 9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.\n    The biggest investment grade deal tentatively scheduled for\npricing this week is 600 mln dlrs of securities due 1992 backed\nby the automobile loan receivables of Marine Midland Banks\n<MM>. Salomon Brothers Inc will head the syndicate.\n    The Marine Midland issue follows last week's offering of\n230 mln dlrs of car loan backed debt by RepublicBank Dallas NA,\na unit of RepublicBank Corp <RPT>, underwriters noted.\n    Goldman, Sachs and Co led the group for the RepublicBank\ndeal. First Boston Corp and Salomon Brothers, the most active\nunderwriters of asset-backed securities, were co-managers.\n    First Boston has dominated the asset-backed market since\nintroducing the concept of selling these securities in March\n1985. It has a commanding 86.1 pct share of the 12.5 billion\ndlr market, according to figures tabluated by First Boston.\n    Salomon Brothers is in second place with a market share of\n8.8 pct, followed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's share of 3.5\npct of the market. Goldman Sachs is next with a 1.6 pct market\nshare that was calculated before the RepublicBank Dallas deal.\n    Indeed, investment bankers say that banks will be the most\nfrequent issuers of asset-backed securities this year.

{"title": "TECHNOLOGY/SUPERCOMPUTER MARKET GETTING CROWDED", "body": "The supercomputer industry is getting\ncrowded as a handful of startup companies and some huge\nJapanese manufacturers compete for the right to apply the label\n\"world's fastest machine\" to their products.\n    Currently there are only about 250 supercomputers installed\naround the world, but many believe that situation is about to\nchange dramatically as these highly specialized and extremely\nexpensive machines move out of the research laboratories where\nmost of them are found today and into commerical applications.\n    \"It is commercial supercomputing... that holds the most\npromise for this young industry's handful of vendors,\" said\nGary Smaby, supercomputer analyst for Piper Jaffray and\nHopwood.\n    These commercial applications, he said, could propel annual\nsales of supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs in 1986 to 2.4\nbillion by 1990.\n    For years two companies, Cray Research Inc <CYR> and\nControl Data Corp  <CDA> were virtually the only options for\ncustomers seeking to buy supercomputers.\n    But in the last three years a number of new companies have\nannounced supercomputers using some innovative technologies,\nand the industry finally expanded enough to hold its first\nWorld Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month.\n    Also in the last month two small companies, ETA Systems Inc\n(a subsidiary of Control Data) and Thinking Machines Corp  both\nlaid claim to having the world's fastest computer and a joint\nventure of Honeywell Inc <HON> and Japan's NEC Corp <NIPN.T>\nHoneywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc, announced its entrance into\nthe U.S. market.\n    All three are aiming at industry leader Cray Research Inc,\nwhich holds more than 60 pct of the market.\n    This week, Cray plans to make a joint announcement with\nDigital Equipment Corp, <DEC> already the world's largest\nminicomputer maker, of some products that will work on both\ncompanies' computers, expanding the market opportunities for\nboth supers and minis even further.\n    Supercomputers were initially designed only for the most\ncomplex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weather\npatterns, fusion energy research or military defense and\nweapons design.\n    They are built for speed, not for standard business\nfunctions such as payroll processing. The fastest\nsupercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations per\nsecond, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personal\ncomputers.\n    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mln\nto 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach\n600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and\n10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation for\nany standard computer company.        \n    But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasized\nthat a host of new applications should increase total industry\nshipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.\n    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the\nmachines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of\nair over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.\n    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street\nbrokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of\nsupercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock\ntrading patterns faster than any of their competitors.\n    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,\nare now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are\nfaster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create\nfinancial models of the stock and bond markets.\n    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual\nsupercomputers are found on Wall Street.\n    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that\nsupercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies\nprovide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control\nData behemoths.\n    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology\ncalled parallel processing, in which a number of internal\nprocessors work together to solve a problem.\n    With such systems a problem is broken up and different\nsegments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,\nstandard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,\nor sequentially.\n    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many as\neight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32\nbillion operations per second.\n    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida State\nUniversity, has only two processors, later to be expanded to\nfour.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 represents\na drastic change in architecture from parent company Control\nData's Cyber system.\n    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 contains\nabout 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto a\nboard about the size of a standard newspaper section.\n    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 miles\nof embedded wiring.\n    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputer\nbut Thorndyke said he expects much faster development time\nframes in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.\n    \"We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the last\nleap,\" he said.\n    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastest\ncomputer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection Machine\nModel CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, but\nit is a very specialized architecture only meant for certain\nvery specific applications.\n    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses a\ntechnology called \"massive parallism.\" It contains 64,000\nprocessors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors all\nwork on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.\n    It is an ideal tool for applications with many\nunpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for\nNovon Research Group. \"The more unpredictable things are, the\nmore the Thinking Machine will be appropriate,\" he said.       \n\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY", "body": "A cut of about half a percentage point\nin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although\neconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.\n    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,\nencouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide\npremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,\nmight lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.\n    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances\nrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its\nrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.\n    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the\nfive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial\nbank borrowings.\n    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German\nrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,\nforcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.\n    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to\nthree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money\nmarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans\nrate on lending under its three month credit quota.\n    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance\nMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.\n    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he\nwould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance\nMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion\nguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct\nfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.\n    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference\nbetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending under\nthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add\nextra liquidity to the money market.\n    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to\nfurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would\nresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,\nprovided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.\n    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its\nparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673\nguilders per 100 marks.\n    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10\nguilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level\nthat would not permit a change in the interest rate\ndifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers\nsaid.\n    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and\nDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he\nsaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\nexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\nin the longer term.\n    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\nor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\npoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\n    \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\nnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\nthe ABN economist said.\n    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\nJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\n    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\ntwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\ncurrently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\nsecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\nspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\nprobably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\nfive pct.\n    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\nthe money market.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

She said the company had data that showed\nimprovement in the heart muscle after the drug was administered\nbut had not included it in the FDA filing.\n \n    Industry analysts also said the 12 point drop in the\ncompany's stock to 37-1/4 was largely expected in light of the\nspeculative nature of the biotechnology companies whose\nfortunes often depend on the success of an important drug.\n    \"In larger pharmaceutical companies each product does not\nhave as much overall significance. But this is very important\nto Genentech,\" said Robert Riley, a senior consultant at Arthur\nD. Little Inc.\n    Some estimated that Genentech could see as much as 1.5\nbillion dlrs from the drug. But with each delay, others can\nenter the market and catch up to Genentech's lead.\n\n    Industry sources pointed out that KabiVitrum, in an\nalliance with Hoechst AG <HFAG.F>, won a recommendation for its\nstreptokinase drug on the same day Genentech's application was\ndelayed. Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used to\ntreat heart attack victims.\n    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc <BHAM.L>\nhas a drug called Eminase which is \"the most likely competitor\nto TPA,\" and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.\nBeecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and is\nawaiting approval in the U.K., he added.\n     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attack\nvictims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.\nAnother method, which involved pumping the drug directly into\nthe heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attack\nwas in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easier\nto administer and worked quickly.\n    But new developments have made streptokinase more effective\nand easier to administer, becoming a potential threat to\nGenentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,\nabout 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA in\nGenentech's path.\n \n    \"Genentech's advantage is being first in the market,\" said\nindustry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst with\nMontgomery Securities in San Francisco. \"They'll be the first\napproved but then they'll face competition after one or two\nyears.\"\n    The company may also face patent pressures for its drug. It\nis currently about to go to court with Beecham Group in the\nU.K. in a patent dispute.

Hutton analyst\nTerence Quinn.\n    That field is a segment of the market known as system\nutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of\na company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,\npower and efficiency of large mainframe computers.\n    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the\ntwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.\nAnalysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that\nwill find the competition much harder than in the past.\n    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a\nsix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,\nN.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.\n    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the\ncompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past \nMicrosoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent\nsoftware vendor.\n    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang\ntook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought\n15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3\nmln dlrs for the year ended March 31.\n    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer\nbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe\ncomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\nmerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\ncompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\nsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\nbecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\nDallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\ndark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n56 cts a share.\n   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\nbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computer\nsoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\nmajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\njob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services\nunit.\n    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\nnews conference that the merger would give computer users a\nsingle source for a wide range of software products.\n    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\nsell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\nin the applications software market, where analysts said it has\nbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.\n    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\nenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\ncompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\nabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\ncurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\nthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\nComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\ncompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\nhe said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\ndlrs a share.\n    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\nof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\nand research and development.\n    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\nBased on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\ndlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\nsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 times\nper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\npremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n\n    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\npct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\nowns 58 pct of Uccel.\n    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\nmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\ndeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\nDepartment.\n    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\nmerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

A relatively small portion of revenue and traffic comes\nfrom intra-U.K. operations, and its predominantly long-haul\nroute network spans the globe.\n    Julius Maldutis at Salomon Brothers said he likes British\nAirways because it can quickly redeploy jets to strong markets\nor away from weak ones, as it did last year in response to the\nsevere downturn in North Atlantic traffic after the Chernobyl\nnuclear disaster and terrorist actions.\n    \"Because of its diverse network, it has the ability to\nhedge or mitigate adverse developments in one particular area,\"\nMaldutis said.\n    He said British Airways should outperform the rest of the\nstock market. Salomon was an underwriter for the company's\npublic offering in February.\n    About 6.3 mln British Airways' American depositary receipts\nare traded on the NYSE, and 2.8 mln ADRs on the Toronto\nexchange.

{"title": "TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET", "body": "European free market tin traders made a\nsomewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur\ndollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.\n    Traders said the new market would probably be a useful\ntrading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin\ninterests although European traders generally appear to be\nreasonably satisfied with the current \"free market\" system\nwhich has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin\ntrading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to\nsee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and\nwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.\n    There is also a view among European traders that, while the\nproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another\nuseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian\ngovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by\nthe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.\n    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of\ntrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while\nthere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject\na definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court\nlitigation actions have been resolved.\n    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently\naround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse\nRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten\nyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as\n4,680 stg in December 1986.\n    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading\nceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350\nstg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.\n    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065\ntonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485\ntonnes reached in February 1986.\n    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late\nlast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand\ndeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting\nprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\n    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\nin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\n4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\n    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\nlittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\n    There was also a lack of significant demand from major\nsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\n    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\nholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\nand the bulk of material still available is being held by\nMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\nmarket with unwanted metal.\n    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\nInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\nsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\nnations of the International Tin Agreement.\n    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\nShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\nhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\nposition.\n    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\nprices and movements are still expected to be largely related\nto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\nemerges for the third quarter.\n    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\nefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\nprices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\nexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\nmajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\napparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\nconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Discount fares in Europe might even\nbecome more widespread.\n    \"We think liberalization will help stimulate traffic,\"\nMarshall said.\n    Lower fares have been offered by British carriers since\ndomestic services in Britain were deregulated in 1984, he said.\nBut passengers taking return flights or from other countries\npay higher, regulated prices.\n    Marshall said deregulation will spawn more European\nairlines, possibly to be followed by a spate of mergers, as is\nhappening in the United States.\n    Two airlines, Sabena and Scandinavian Airlines System\n(SAS), are now discussing a merger. Their success \"might open\nup Europe to further merger activity,\" he said.\n    This is because an SAS-Sabena merger could be a test case\nto determine whether countries are willing to allow landing\nrights to be transferred from one carrier to another, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

He\nwould not comment on the new offer.\n    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as\ndisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to\nretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to\nconsumers by cable television.\n    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to\n87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit\nwent to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.\n    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,\nElias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in\na statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase\nof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to\nassist in financing the balance.\n    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to\nborrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since\nCrazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same\namount.\n    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday\nto 9.50.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

During World War II it produced the\nunique wooden Mosquito bomber for the Allied Command.\n    In the postwar years that de Havilland became renowned\ninternationally for its rugged bush planes.\n    Canada's Liberal government, interested in developing de\nHavilland's STOL (Short Take Off and Landing) technology,\nacquired the firm in 1974 and poured 830 mln Canadian dlrs into\nit over a dozen years, helping to develop the 50-seat Dash 7\nand 39-seat Dash 8 commuter aircraft.\n    Amid accusations of a sellout, the pro-business\nConservative government sold the company to Boeing in 1986 for\n90 mln Canadian dlrs, or less than the price of one of Boeing's\n747s.\n    Woodard believes de Havilland, which has not made a profit\nsince 1982, suffered from neglect under government control.

A preliminary\ninjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until\nthe case is decided.\n    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr\nbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share\nlower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens\nlast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens\noffer.\n    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and\nDominion used illegally obtained confidential information about\nthe company in making their takeover attempt.\n \n    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James\nAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber\nGroup Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23\nyears, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's\nsales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,\n1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to\ndivulge inside information about the company.\n    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began\nworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to\n\"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its\nmanagement,\" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.\n    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from\nPaineWebber, but argued the information was public information\nand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or\nBurlington's public financial statements.\n    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with\nEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with\nthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went\npublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.\nBurlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a\ntakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in\nFebruary.\n    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held\ndiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as\nfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off\nbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and\ndominion with a written statement that they did not provide\ninside information.\n    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen\nwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman\nFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and\nthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an\neffort to takeover Burlilgnton.\n    \"The ultimate question is not the price per share or the\nprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for\nthose who would takeover an American company,\" said burlington\nlawyer Humphrey.\n    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the\nlargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in\nviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's\nlargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants\nin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,\nthe lawyers said.\n    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the\nmarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends\nand that Burlington has the ability to switch between light\nweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price\ndictate.\n    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by\nBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid\nfor Dominion. \"Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose\nwould have been sauce for the gander,\" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,\na Samjens lawyer.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.\n    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole\nwould probably be between one and two pct.\n   \"It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic\ndemand does not grow strongly,\" he said, noting that interest\nrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.\n    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money\nstock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace\nof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six\npct target.\n    He said the target could still be achieved but much will\ndepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy\ninflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS\nrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.\n    \"There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of\nforeign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit\nreversed,\" Schlesinger said.\n    A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction\nthat the mark was headed higher. \"As we can see from the market,\nexpectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have\ndiminished,\" Schlesinger said.\n    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the\nfact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period\nand an improvement in real trade balances have all combined\ntowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.\n    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar\nrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87\nmarks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.\n    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.\n    \"Central banks are always in contact about these\nfluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,\"\nSchelsinger said.\n    \"One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,\" he said,\nadding, \"It is not only our own case, it is also the American\ncase.\"\n    He said that the West German export industry has been hit\nhard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see\nsome correction now. \"But it wouldn't be good to have short-term\nfluctuations,\" he said. \"Let us wait and see.\"\n    \"It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very\nshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level\n(of rates) as such,\" Schlesinger said.\n    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of\nsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West\nGerman inflation down year.\n    Although there have recently been signs of inflation\npicking up, he said that this was due to changes in key\ncommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would\nbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.\n    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth\nwas longer term, in that the economy was building up the\npotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.\n    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16\nmonths had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of\ntargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the\nmid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.\n    But he added: \"I don't see any great pressure to go away\nfrom it.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The market\ntrades treasury bills and bonds.\n    Available liquid funds were still moving into traditional\ninvestments because share prices were rising and returns were\nlow on fixed income securities, Yeo said.\n    He said the lack of market information and investment\neducation for potential investors were limiting factors.\n    Referring to the securitisation of corporate debt, he said\n\"If the saving between a traditional bank loan and a public\noffering is not great, investors prefer to take the loan\nbecause it does not require the public disclosure of\ninformation.\"\n    William K.K. Wong, managing director of Indosuez Asia\n(Singapore) Ltd, said institutional investors this year had\nfocussed on the equity market rather than bonds.\n    Bankers and analysts said the new market would pave the way\nfor the development of corporate bond issues.\n    The bankers said development of an active fixed income\nsecurities market would encourage more private and public\ncompanies to issue debt instruments.\n    They said they hoped the risk-free government bond yield\ncurve would provide a benchmark for corporate bonds and other\ndebt instruments.\n    Economists and bankers said the recent share offer by\nSembawang Maritime Ltd, which was oversubscribed 92.3 times and\nwhich raked in a record 6.80 billion dlrs, showed the flow of\nliquidity into the share market. The previous record of 1.96\nbillion dlrs was set in April by Avimo Singapore Ltd.\n    Wong said total average daily turnover of the government\nsecurities market had fallen sharply due to share issues.\n    He said there were at most seven active participants,\nmainly banks. Other financial institutions were on the\nsidelines because the securities market concept was new.\n    Wong said the recent revision of the minimum liquid asset\nratio to 18 pct allows banks to restructure liquid assets and\ninject more long term funds into the securities market.\n    One of the primary dealers, United Overseas Bank Ltd, has\nan average daily turnover of over 100 mln dlrs but this could\nrise to 300 mln on active option days, deputy manager Ho Kian\nFah told Reuters.\n    Ho said major participants, besides the primary and\nregistered dealers, were mainly U.S. And U.K. Banks which\nshowed a willingness to quote prices.\n    Loh Hoon Sun, general manager of the Overseas Union Bank\nLtd, said he forsees active trading and bidding of new\nofferings in pre-issued business. Loh estimated OUB's average\nturnover to be around 50 mln to 100 mln dlrs on active days.\n    Dealers said a significant factor was that the t-bill and\nmoney market rate yield gap had narrowed, making rates for\nbills more competitive with those in the money market.\n    Tan Mong Tong, executive director of National Discount Co\nLtd, told reporters the new securities market would enable\nbanks, statutory bodies, insurance companies to manage their\nfunds more flexibly.\n    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) plans to issue\neight to 10.5 billion dlrs of taxable instruments in the first\nyear and a gross issue of 35 billion dlrs over five years.\n    The first issue of 300 mln dlrs worth of T-bills by the MAS\nwas 1.9 times subscribed while the first issue of 500 mln dlrs\nworth of five-year bonds was three times oversubscribed. The\nrecent issue of 300 mln dlrs of two-year bonds received 1.17\nbillion dlrs in applications.\n    The new securities market operated by MAS on an electronic\nbook entry system will provide new investment outlets intended\nto develop Singapore's capital market, bankers said.\n    But the market is new and long term success and expansion\nwill depend on how the MAS and the primary and registered\ndealers stimulate activity, the bankers and analysts said.\n    They said it was necessary to promote liquidity because\ninvestors did not negotiate frequently enough and tended to\nhold on to their investments.\n    They advocated the establishment of a market makers\nassociation to help investors understand the market and its\ninstruments as a lack of speculative activity limits market\nturnover and supply.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Last year's GNP\ngrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.\n    \"Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources\nand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that\ndomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and\nwould not be a stumbling block,\" Fernandez said.\n    \"I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at\nkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,\nshowed that the economy was on a different track from last\nyear,\" he said.\n    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the\nfirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it\ncould drop off in the third quarter.\n    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the\nmanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in\n1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.\n    \"That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,\" he said.\n    He said the government had met all monetary targets set for\nthe first quarter in consultation with the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF).

But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in\nOctober last year, had almost been completed.\n    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level\ntouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.\n\"Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,\" he said.\n    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, \"I\nthink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own\nreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap\nforward as might have been suitable.\"\n    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach\n29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.\n    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first\nquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.\n    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of\nbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while\ngrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.\n    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some\neconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the\ndollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more\ncompetitive.\n    \"By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso\nhas already substantially devalued against all of the country's\ntrading partners,\" he said.\n    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was\nopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted\nrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first two\nyears after the imposition of the Code.\n    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has\nbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.\n    \"I think any central bank, certainly this one after the\nevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to be\nprudent.

{"title": "POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK", "body": "For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is\nthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has\nplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for\nthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the\nmark.\n    President of the powerful and independent West German\ncentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his\ncontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the\nend of this year, government officials say.\n    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)\n    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising\neyebrows in West Germany's business community.\n    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top\nministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in\nopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.\n    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl\nwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own\nChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked\nclosely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\nVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\nreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\nPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\nWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\nFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\nChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\ndollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\nthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\nwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\ninflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\nof galloping inflation this century.\n    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\ninflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\nto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\ndangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n    \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\ndollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\nBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\nwould endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\njournalists in Frankfurt recently.\n    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\nPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n    \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\nfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\neconomy,\" she said.\n    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\nidentified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\ncertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\nrigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\npersuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\nPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\nthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\ncurrencies.\n    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\ndealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\nfact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n    \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\ndon't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\nintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\nround, making a speculator's position worthless.\n    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\nin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\na glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\nplay golf.\n    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\nfor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n    \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\nif you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\nare very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\nmany people,\" he said.

{"title": "CHINA DELAYS REFORM BECAUSE OF POLITICS, ECONOMICS", "body": "China had postponed wide-ranging plans to\nreform its economy because of financial difficulties and\npressure from powerful conservatives within the ruling\nCommunist Party, western diplomats said.\n    But they said that although the conservatives were critical\nof aspects of the current open-door policy they had no\nalternative economic program. That meant that the strategy\nbegun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on,\nbut at a slower pace, they said.\n    Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economy\nbuilt during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976\nliving standards have risen sharply and China has become a net\nexporter of grain for the first time.\n    A western diplomat said China's leaders had been\nsufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order the\ndrawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These included\nchanges to the country's price system.\n    But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved since\neconomic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation of\nCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January.\n    The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not be\non the agenda for a major party meeting later this year.\n    The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a system\nunder which factories sign contracts with the government. They\ncan keep any profit over and above the contract amount.\n    \"This is a modest reform, a repeat of what China did in the\nearly 1980s,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew up\nthe more ambitious plans. But these are impractical in the\ncurrent political and economic climate,\" he said.\n    A Chinese source said that a month ago Premier Zhao Ziyang\ndecided the media was giving too much coverage to the drive\nagainst bourgeois liberalism and not enough to explaining the\nproposed reforms. Some of these reforms, like price increases,\nwere very unpopular.\n    Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reforms\nand why they were necessary, the source said.\n    One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Daily\nlast week, \"Failure to answer people's questions about the new\nprices has caused great anxiety.\"\n    In March, China announced budget deficits for 1986 and\n1987. It has had two years of trade deficits, and capital\nspending and wages are rising fast.\n    On the political front, the conservatives in the Party have\nbeen on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. He\nallegedly failed to fight the growth of western democratic\nideas, which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism.\n    A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has been\nunder way since January in the Party and the media. The latter\nhas given wide coverage to those in the leadership who have\nwarned against the errors of all-out westernisation.\n    The economist said, \"Although reform in any country\ninevitably causes anxiety and is often risky, it has been\nproved that, where reform is more daring, commodities are more\nabundant and people's living standards higher.\"\n    \"But in the countries that are more rigid, the market is\nstagnant, goods are in short supply and rationing is common,\" he\nsaid.\n    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete their\nunfinished overhaul of China's pricing system.\n    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factories\nindependent of the government which would use taxes, credit\nsupply and other indirect means to regulate them instead of\nadministrative diktat as in the past.\n    \"But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stable\neconomy, contented workers and surpluses, to give them\nmanoeuvring room. These conditions do not exist now,\" he said.\n    Another diplomat said that conservatives within the\nleadership, though critical of some results of the reforms, had\nno alternative economic strategy.\n    \"The last eight years of opening to the outside world has\nshown everyone how poor China is and how it has fallen behind\nother countries,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"Everyone is agreed on the objective that China become a\nmajor world power by the early 21st century,\" he said.\n    \"For this, it needs a strong and modernised economy. Where\nthere is disagreement is over the pace of the reforms and the\ndetails of some of them.\"\n    The Chinese source said the debate over the pace and extent\nof reforms was still going on.\n    (See ECRA for spotlight index)\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Our mandate is to finance investment-related\nactivities,\" Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's resident\nrepresentative in the Philippines, told Reuters in an\ninterview.\n    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a\nWorld Bank mission that came in March to review the land reform\nprogram and which said the bank would not be able to finance\ncompensation payments for the transfer of land.\n    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bank\nto finance land transfers, and the bank's position should not\nbe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.\n    \"Clearly in the case of land reform the question of land\ntransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed\nto the landless,\" Arrivillaga said. \"However, the bank as an\ninstitution can finance the development aspects of the program.\"\n    \"We will deal with the part of the program that deals with\nhow to put the land to effective use once it has been\ntransferred and how to make the on-farm investments that are\nneeded to attain the goal of improving the income level of the\nbeneficiaries,\" Arrivillaga said.\n    \"I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions\nare faced with similar constraints,\" he said.\n    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week that\nshe was committed to launching the program, which limits land\nholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers of\nrule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.\n    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reform\nprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would be\nimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.\n    Benigno said the first two phases would complete the\ntransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well\nas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosed\nby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.\n    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of large\nsugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to the\nCongress to work out the details, Benigno said.\n    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of a\nconsultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared to\nfinance the land transfers.\n    \"I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how\ninternational sources of finance would behave in a situation\nlike this, because land reform by its very nature requires rich\nfinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable\nto both the landowner and the beneficiary,\" he said.\n    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the government\nwould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land\ntransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if there\nwere gaps.\n    \"In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of\nthe government is how it confronts the domestic resource\nrequirement,\" Arrivillaga said. \"Multilateral agencies by their\nvery nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have to\nbe convinced that the government prioritises the program.\"\n    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costs\nunder an earlier land reform program launched by former\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had been\nchannelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).\n    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino's\nprogram.\n    \"If asked to do so again and the program is designed to\nimprove the standard of living of the poor then we would\ncertainly be prepared to consider (lending),\" Arrivillaga said.\n    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the\ncosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-year\ncontext.\n    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its\nfinancing problems by devising effective instruments to\ncompensate landowners.\n    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners are\nlikely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bonds\nwith 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.\n    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate\nlandowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and\nadded: \"The challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments\nthat is as good as cash.\"\n    He said the international financing community was watching\nthe Philippine experiment with great interest.\n    \"They are going to be an interesting model for many other\ncountries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to\nevery sector of the population and even international\ninstitutions,\" he said. \"I think they'll be on a very solid base\nwhen they make the decision to launch the reforms.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "FEW EXPECT NEW ECONOMIC INITIATIVES IN VENICE", "body": "The Venice summit on June 8-10 is likely\nto disappoint those hoping for new policies to whip up flagging\nworld growth, according to officials from summit countries.\n    Worries over protectionist threats and the Third World debt\ncrisis are also unlikely to be assuaged, they added.\n    The talks may yield agreed statements on the military\nsituation in the Gulf, co-operation in the fight against the\nkiller disease AIDS or on East-West relations, they said.\n    But most summit participants have made it clear that major\nnew initiatives on economic issues must not be expected.\n    West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a recent\ninterview that \"the translation of previous announcements into\npolicy is more important than new declarations and commitments.\"\n    The main goal at the summit would be to strengthen existing\nagreements to secure steady medium term growth and avoid \"the\ndanger of a further devaluation of the dollar\" via close\nco-operation on economic and financial policies, Kohl added.\n    Critics challenged this view. They pointed to the worrying\nbackground of slower growth, especially in Japan and Germany,\namid fears about a pickup in inflation in the U.S. Which could\nlead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis.\n    The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar, yen\nand mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and German\ntrade surpluses and U.S. Trade and fiscal deficits since the\nSeptember 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern.\n    Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely to\nbe quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments in\nVenice.\n    But government officials do not expect summit delegations -\nfrom the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada\nand the European Community - to go much beyond restating policy\ngoals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group of\nSeven finance ministers and central bankers.\n    Under the agreement, aimed at halting the dollar's 20-month\ndecline and at fostering balanced growth, Japan and West\nGermany would work to eliminate their trade and payments\nsurpluses in return for a U.S. Pledge to reduce fiscal\ndeficits.\n    A 6,000 billion yen package announced by Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal and\nappeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summit\nattack on its economic policies, officials said.\n    The package, featuring government spending and tax cuts to\nstimulate demand, drew a cautious welcome in European capitals\nbut its reception in the U.S. Was much more enthusiastic.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker commented, \"Of course,\nimplementation is the key, but this is clearly forward movement\ntoward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments.\"\n    With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domestic\ndemand rather than rely on exports for growth, the U.S. And\nother summit countries were now set to shift their attention to\nWest Germany and press Kohl for similar action, officials said.\n    U.S. Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said there\nwas worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged,\nand the U.S. Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment that\npolicies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish.\n    But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resist\nany such pressure. One senior Bonn official said, \"There is just\nno room for manoeuvre for any economic moves.\"\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems finding\ncash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990, and is reluctantly\nletting government borrowing rise, Bonn officials said.\n    Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain,\nEuropean officials also ruled out progress on U.S. Plans for a\nmore formal strategy for coordinating economic policies, based\non a series of economic indicators.\n    The U.S. Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree to\nhigh level consultations when the indicators, including trade,\ngrowth, interest and exchange rates, inflation and fiscal\ndeficits, show members are not living up to economic\ncommitments.\n  But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermine\neconomic sovereignty, and Britain also feels the proposals are\ntoo complicated and too rigid, officials said.\n    Recent developments on Third World debt, including moves by\ntwo of the largest U.S. Banks to set aside billions of dollars\nto cover bad loans, will feature prominently in the talks.\n    U.S. And Japanese officials said they would seek to\nreactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a call\nto commercial banks to come up with a \"menu of alternatives\" to\nrestore some new bank lending to debtor countries.\n    Officials said there was also scope for agreement on a\nFranco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for the\nworld's poorest debtor countries through concessional\nrescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club.\n    The talks would also include plans to dismantle runaway\nfarm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the income\nof their farmers and secure a share of world markets, they\nsaid.\n    The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD) last month supported a gradual\ndecoupling of farm production subsidies from income support for\nfarmers.\n    The U.S., Canada and Britain in particular are keen to move\nquickly after the OECD breakthrough, officials said.\n    \"What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they do\nnow. We want to see to it that our farmers will be able to\ncompete in international markets,\" Canadian Prime Minister Brian\nMulroney said.\n    The U.S. Intends to table specific proposals on the issue\nat GATT, the world trade body, immediately after the summit to\nsignal that it wants negotiations on farm trade to take\nprecedence over the other trade issues included in the new GATT\nround of talks launched last year in Punta del Este, Uruguay.\n    \"We won't have much tolerance for delay,\" U.S. Agriculture\nSecretary Richard Lyng said.\n    But European officials said they would resist such moves,\nmaking an agreement at the summit unlikely.

This would leave a budget deficit\nbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\nGDP.\n    The government, having consistently overshot its own\nspending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\ncredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\nbudget, analysts said.\n    \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"\nsaid Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\n    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\nattention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\ntheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\nmoney and capital markets.\n    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending\nwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\nbillion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\npct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\nIMF.\n    \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted\none analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\nfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\ntwo years.\n    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\npolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisis\ntriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\nloans to the country in September 1985.\n    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\nper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\ngovernment officials say economic growth is the prime\nobjective.\n    But private-sector economists caution that the government's\nability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\nconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\ncurrent account of the country's balance of payments.\n    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\nbillion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\nnation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\narrangement reached earlier this year with major international\ncreditor banks.\n    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\nlittle room to manoeuvre.\n    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\nbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\nSouth African Transport Services suggest that major tax\nconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\n    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\nfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\nelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.\n    \"This will not be a very exciting budget,\" commented Harry\nSchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive\nFederal Party. \"I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the\nsweets were given out before the election.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "NEW PROBLEMS FOR WORLD BANK IN DEBT STRATEGY", "body": "The World Bank, in the throes of a\npainful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions by\nCitibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,\nfinancial analysts and monetary sources said.\n    The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused\nsome bad feelings and charges that promotions and other\npersonnel actions have been based on personality rather than\nability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role\nin the global debt strategy, the sources said.\n    At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber\nConable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some \ncritical review from many Bank staff members and some member-\ncountries including the United States.\n    \"I think if he were to do it again, he would do it very\ndifferently,\" said one source.\n    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed by\nPresident Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly\na year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be\nreorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.\n    In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan\nadministration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient\nbureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market\nsources of assistance were available.\n    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greater\nrole under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury\nSecretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20\nbillion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine\nbillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the\nWorld Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by\nCitibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.\n    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives\nall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the\nbeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete\nunraveling of the monetary system.\n    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for\nBrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does\nnot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.\n    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop\nfinancing the country's export credits, the funds countries use\nto support their daily activities, leading to an economic\nbreakdown.\n    \"Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of\nbusiness,\" said one source.\n    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three\nbillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans\nto developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by\nChase Manhattan some days later.\n    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was\ndemonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\nmultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and\ncommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could\nemerge again but no one is expecting that.\n    If anything, the negotiations have become much more\nconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more\nconcessions, arguing that they face growing political\ninstability if they are asked to do or pay more.\n    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and\nthere is sympathy for their view among the development\ncommunity.\n    \"When you hear code words like structural adjustment and\ntightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent\nmaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs,\" says one\nsource.\n    He adds: \"And when your hear they should have market forces\nat play, that means the level of public services should drop.\"\n    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role\nin the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the\ndebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent\npoverty even further.\n   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the building\nof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called\ninfrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.\n   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy\nfollowing the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near\ndefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little\nsympathy or even understanding of poverty.\n    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative\nhas worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about\nincreased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription\nwhich indicated that countries might grow their way out of\ntheir difficulty.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.\n    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on \"a gradual reduction\nof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.\"\n    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced\n\"satisfactory exchange rate stability,\" in part thanks to heavy\ncoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and\nhe was \"content\" with sterling's exchange rate.\n    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May\ncurrency reserves announced today he said, \"we have been playing\na very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a\nvery much greater extent than we had done hitherto.\"\n    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may\nfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economic\ncommitments underlying the accord.\n    \"Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange\nrate stability if countries are seen not to implement their\ncommitments in Paris ... In this respect.\" He said the U.S.\nBudget deficit was \"very important.\"\n    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by\nJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson\nsaid, \"what is really needed in Japan is an increase in\nmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.\"\n    \"There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural\ngoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is\nwholly unjustified,\" he said.\n    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in \"Japan\nbashing\" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation\npackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase\nJapanese development aid over the next three years.\n    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange\nmembership would also help deflect criticism, he said.\n    He said he thought West Germany would instead come under\npressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to\njack up faltering economic growth.\n    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring\nforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts\nscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with\nthe privatisation of German national industries.\n    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan\nto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to\nmake progress in Venice.\n    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign\ndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World\nBank meetings in Washington earlier this year.\n    Lawson said he would seek \"to consolidate political backing\nfor the plan at the Venice summit\" and hoped the programme would\nbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.\n    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase\nManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt\nprovisions.\n    \"First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market\nresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from this\nsort of move than they felt before Citicorp,\" he said.\n    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,\nstrengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.\n\"They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,\"\nLawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to\ndetermine the appropriate size of provisions.\n    He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be\ndiscussed at the summit. \"There is a consensus, which we have to\npush further.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six\nmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the\nsame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.\n    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.\n\n    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond\ndescribing it as a long term investment.\n    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is\na leader in building materials, Herbert said.\n    \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.\n    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its\ncore businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves\ninto energy several years ago.\n    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert\nsaid: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is.

That would not\nrepresent a tightening of policy, however.\n    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\nat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\nallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\nto lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\nUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\non this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\nSaarland bordering France, and was twice under French\noccupation this century.\n    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\nthis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\nto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\ntreated for minimum reserve purposes.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

He is a central banker of\ngood repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And\ninternational banking system,\" said Libra's Santistevan.\n    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted\ncountries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as\nfamiliar with the problem and the personalities involved.\n    For this reason he expects there will be little change in\nthe Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial\nbanks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding\nbillions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on\nthird world debt.\n    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American\ndebt problem also doubted there would be much change\npost-Volcker, but for other reasons.\n    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's\ndebt initiative which called for greater contributions by\nbanks, governments and multilateral organization, government's\nhave done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the\nbulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.\n    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he\nquestioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the\njob so close to the next Presidential election.\n    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the\nfinancial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on\nforeign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank\nintervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover\nsomewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one\npoint, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost\nmore than one point.\n    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank\nPlc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the\nannouncement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the\ndollar against the mark and yen.\n    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar\nhas fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today\nannouncing his nomination Greenspan said \"there certainly is\nevidence\" that the dollar had bottomed out.\n    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise\nin the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to\nfall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to\nreverse.\n    \"The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few\nyears\" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important\nthing is that there is a soft landing.\n    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear\nGreenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.\n    \"He has everything going for him but he must establish\ncredibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the\noutlook for interest rates,\" he said.\n    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a\nstance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his\ntightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to\nrecord levels.\n    \"He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only\nrelaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted\n(in 1982),\" National Westminster's Lomax said.\n    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit the\nagreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the\nGroup of Five industrial nations on the dollar.\n    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stability\nbeing maintained because of a monetary policy that is too\ntight.

The other five members are Reagan appointees.\n    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that the\nFed governors now have only six to seven years' collective\nexperience between them, at a time of great financial\nuncertainty.\n    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered\nas tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republican\ncredentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman\nthan Volcker.\n    An administration official said Volcker was consulted on\nGreenspan \"and very much approved of his replacement.\"\n    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the\nadministration, to whom he has been an unofficial economic\nadviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had\nwith the Nixon administration.\n    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration\nviewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to\nmake radical policy changes.\n    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker told\nreporters, \"I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness\nyesterday.\" Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the\nWhite House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.\n    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he would\nprobably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the\ndeparture of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor\nthat convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost\nfrom the start of the administration.\n    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being able\nto work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the\ninternational debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying\ndollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Suddenly\nthere's a terrible void,\" one New York banker said.\n    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missed\nbecause International Monetary Fund managing director Michel\nCamdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding it\nhard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.\n    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has little\nexperience of international affairs and third world debt.\n    \"Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issues\nand the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volcker\nhas. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.\nThat was in his gut.

In particular, he was roundly criticized by some for\nmore or less forcing them last September to grant Mexico\ngenerous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debt\nrescheduling agreement.\n    \"Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping the\nbounds and pushing the package onto the banks,\" commented one\nbanker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.\n    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who said\nthe 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders and\nthus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.\n    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and of\nothers that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippines\nand Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debt\ncrisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed to\nbolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.\n    \"It certainly contributed to the general feeling of\nmalaise,\" one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact of\nthe Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billion\ndlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.\n    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan and\nSecurity Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy of\ncreditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.\n    But no one is sure what the impact will be. \"It's very\ndifficult for anyone to know which way the debt problem is\ngoing, and with Volcker out of the picture it just adds to the\nuncertainty,\" one banker said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved\nharvest conditions in the southern Midwest.\n    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean\nplants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit\nyoung plants by encouraging the development of deep root\nsystems, Bartholomew said.\n    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to\nactive buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean\norders went unfilled at the close, traders said.\n    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)\nmeteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not\nsuffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.\n    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the\ndollar, which can depress prices by making grains more\nexpensive for foreign buyers.\n    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's\nCOMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle\nsteady.\n    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the\nweather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of\ninflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,\nwhich closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.\ntrade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.\n    A USDA report released after trading said the number of\ncattle being fed in seven major producing states was above\nlevels expected by traders. Traders said the report would\nprobably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange.\n    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52\nmln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade\nforecasts.\n    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,\nup 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off\n93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.\n    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot\nweather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Other factors influencing the\ndecision may also have been clearing problems in May which\nforced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in\nan effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,\nespecially in silver futures.\n    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for\nother exchanges to successfully offer precious metals\ncontracts, industry sources say.\n    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges\ncan inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume\nof more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to\nbuy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.\n    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold\ncontract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,\nwas under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has\nsurpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.\n    \"The climate could not be better for this venture by the\nCME,\" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil\nMcGarrity.\n    \"Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting\ndaily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.\nThere's good trading volume in all world outlets,\" McGarrity\nadded.\n    \"The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,\nmerchants and customers that there would be a market open for\ntrading,\" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the\nComex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice\npresident and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.\nInc. and a Comex board member.\n    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold\nfutures.

The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.\n    MITI also said the so-called \"J-curve\" and the drop in oil\nprices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6\nbillion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.\n    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose\nto a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.\n    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5\nbillion dlrs and the \"J-curve\" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in\nthe 1986 surplus.\n    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in\nrecent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be\naccounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in\neconomic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36\npct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.\n    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982\nto 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange\nrates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of\nimports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic\ngrowth rates.

The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of\nrecord production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated\nin Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity\nin South Korea.\n    \"Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also\nexpected in 1987,\" Briggs said.\n    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels\nat existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with\nachievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro\nin Canada.\n    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable\nopening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity\nof 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.\n    \"Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there\nwill be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,\" he\nadded.\n    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of\nzinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore\nsupply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from\nzinc mines.\n    \"On this basis, our calculations point to a modest\noversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,\" Briggs said.\n    The copper forecast, however, was for a record\nnon-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,\nincreasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.\n    Production of primary refined copper metal would also\nincrease, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to\na moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes\nthis year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the\ndecade, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Soaring land and share prices have boosted\nreceipts, especially from securities and land taxes.\n    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in\nthe current supplementary budget, the rest will be available\nfor a second supplementary budget expected later this year.\n    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the\ngovernment's wage bill, which will not be known until after\nwage talks later this year, one official said.\n    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than\n1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package\nbut which will not be contained in the first supplementary\nbudget, due to be presented to parliament next month.\n    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax\ncarry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year\nwill be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he\nsaid.\n    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue\ndeficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this\nyear's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.\n    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also\nintends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during\nthe upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.\n    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform\nbill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five\npct sales tax.\n    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in\nindividual and corporate income taxes.\n    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax\ncut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an\noverhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.\n    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax\nbreaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October\nas originally planned, they said.\n    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance\nMinistry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its\nso-called minus ceiling for public investment.\n    That policy calls on government departments to cut public\ninvestment spending by five pct per year.\n    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the\npolicy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation\nfrom the government's administrative reform council.\n    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that\nbudget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be\nreviewed.\n    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau\nsaid they were hopeful the policy would be retained.\n    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public\ninvestment could lead to increased pressure on the government\nto loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.\n    The account would also extend interest-free loans to\nprofitable public works projects developed in conjunction with\nthe private sector, the officials said.\n    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing\npressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a\ntight grip on outlays by other government departments.\n    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could\ntotal about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market\nprice, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more\nthan 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned\nfor in the main 1987/88 budget.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The panel, appointed\nin August by President Junius Jayewardene, submitted its report\nto him on April 20. A copy was obtained by Reuters. The report\nwill be made available to the public by next week.\n    The three-man commission recommended its findings be passed\nto state law officers to decide whether penal action was\nnecessary against any members of the former board or Air\nLanka's management. The airline comes under the Defence\nMinistry, a portfolio held by Jayewardene himself.\n    The commission said Air Lanka's reports to Jayewardene\n\"blurred\" its true financial health. It said the airline had\nirretrievably lost its share capital of 3.8 billion rupees.\n    To finance deficits, it had also used up a treasury loan of\n800 mln rupees and part of foreign currency loans obtained for\naircraft purchases and infrastructure needs, it said.\n    \"Air Lanka is thus indebted to overseas lenders to the value\nof one billion rupees without any productive assets or\ncollateral to provide for its repayment,\" the commission said.\n    It said the airline's losses were assessed at 5.59 billion\nrupees at March 31, 1986. But cumulative losses would reach 7.7\nbillion, implying Air Lanka lost money at the rate of 1.3\nbillion rupees a year between 1979, when it started, and 1986.\n    \"These results must rank as the most devastating financial\ntragedy ever suffered in Sri Lanka's commercial history,\" the\ncommission said.\n    The report said the airline's dangerously critical\nfinancial condition was due to uncontrolled spending --\nparticularly the way in which the airline expanded its fleet --\npoor marketing, and extreme laxity in cost controls.\n    \"It is clear to us that Air Lanka's misfortunes are largely\nof its own creation and that the reponsibility must rest\nprimarily with the board of directors,\" it said.\n    Air Lanka had blamed its problems on the effects on tourism\nof Sri Lanka's Tamil separatist rebellion, the depreciating\nrupee and under-capitalisation. The commission dismissed these\nas invalid.\n    The report said most of the major problems stemmed from\nconcentration of power by Captain S.R. Wikramanayake who held\nthe posts of both chairman and managing director.\n    \"It is mainly he who has to be responsible for whatever the\nstatus of Air Lanka is in today,\" it said.\n    Wikramanayake resigned with the other board members last\nNovember. He could not be contacted for comment.\n    The commission recommended that its findings should be\npassed \"to the law officers of the state ... To ascertain if\npenal action is necessary against any or all members of the\nformer board of Air Lanka or its management staff.\"\n    The panel recommended equity involvement of one or more\nforeign airlines in Air Lanka and the granting of maximum\nconcessions to make the carrier attractive to foreign and local\ninvestment. It also suggested selling assets, such as two\nBoeing 747s financed by U.S. Dollar loans, to reduce debt.\n    It said Air Lanka and the government should renegotiate\nU.S. Dollar-denominated debts into other currencies which form\nthe core of earnings and obtain lower interest rates.

Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\nsubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\nand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\nand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\nsaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\nbe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\na strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\nfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\ngrain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\nsavings Glickman claims.\n    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\nsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\nARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\nwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\nwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\npct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\ncommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\nsignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\nthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\nsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\nunfair to one commodity.\n    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\nlikely to eventually look for budget savings are some\ntightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \nadoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\nbut not enough, they said.\n    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\ncommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\nall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\nsupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\nFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

But diminished\ncustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\nmarketing incentives have helped their sales.\n    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\nmeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\nbetter priced grades in a \"package.\"\n    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\nfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\nchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\nfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\nits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\nprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\npoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\nwhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\n    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\nmln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\nand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\nor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\nmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\ntarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\nanalysts say.\n    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\nnon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\ncrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\nExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\nexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\nonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\nofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\nor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\nwhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\npay the new prices.\n   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\nwas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\nits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\ndue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\nrisen.\n    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\nits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\nGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\ndifferentials question in Vienna.\n    \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\nholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The strength of the economy and broad money\ngrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the near\nterm,\" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.\n    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's\nmortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies\nsaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.\nRates.\n    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that\na post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such\noptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which\nmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's\nstrength.\n    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm\nabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment\nrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly\nreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying\naverage earnings in April, dealers said.\n    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending\nrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank\nof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset\nthe impact on domestic money supply of its current\nintervention.\n    \"The gilt market reaction was correct,\" said Bill Martin,\nchief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.\n    \"That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very\ngood state indeed,\" Skeoch said.\n    \"There's no reason to get worries about inflationary\npressures because they're very subdued.\" Unit wage cost rises\nwere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to\nApril, and it was these costs rather than average earnings\nwhich were potentially inflationary, he added.\n    \"I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major\nproblem,\" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.\n    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried\nabout the funding implications of recent intervention.\n    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets\nearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that\nthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now\nlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try\nto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.\n    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson\nSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would still\ntrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal\nhigher inflation this year.\n    \"Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As\nlong as that continues we're okay,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

In March, the government said 1988 tax cuts\nwould be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.\n    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemann\ncountered a joint call from all five German economic institutes\nto speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endanger\nefforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowing\ndown.\n    Financing the tax reform has become an \"acute problem,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    \"Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comes\nup against political opposition. There will be a lot more\ncriticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed to\nfinance the reform has been accounted for,\" the report said.\n    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how to\nraise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.\nSubsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.\n    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,\neconomics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,\nhave conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marks\nare unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to be\nfound.\n    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to help\nfinance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope with\nthis, the report said.\n    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, the\njunior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonn\nwill eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) due\nto tax harmonisation measures within the European Community. A\nVAT increase will also provide funds for income tax reform, the\nreport said.\n    Viewed in the context of efforts by Bonn, Washington and\nTokyo to reform taxes, \"despite its various shortcomings, West\nGermany's planned tax reform is better than its reputation,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    The effective cut in the income tax burden carried by West\nGermans will be greater than in the U.S., Although the rate\nreductions are smaller and income tax levels will remain higher\noverall, the report said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

Would justify asking consumers to\nmake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem\nwithin that sector by paying a levy.\"\n    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of\nbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds\nproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.\n    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European\nCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0\nbillion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"\nagreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\nfeel the full impact of its enlargement.\n    The Commission has proposed several cost and production\ncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\nguaranteed quantity system, he added.\n    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\nprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\nEcus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\nsaid.\n    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\namount when market prices are below or above this level.\n    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\namount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\nPolicy's oils and fats regime.\n    \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\nproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\nor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.\n    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\n    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\nto domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\nit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\n    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\nunder present aid arrangements, he said.\n    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\nproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\nimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\nTanghe said.\n    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\nrequirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\neffect would stabilise Community production levels without\naffecting demand, he said.\n    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\nimport levels, he said.\n    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\nimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\nrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\nFurthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\nbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\nlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\nby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\n    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\nmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\nsaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\npart of the plan.\n    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\nindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\nthe five-year restructuring plan.\n    Company officials said although reserves were being\ndepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\nend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\nthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\nkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\nstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\nsent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\nTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\nfuel.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\nNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n    \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\nmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\nto make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\ndescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\ntakeover target.\n    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\ngets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\nNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\nshare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\nthree yesterday.\n    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\nPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\nsplit.

Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\nreturned telephone calls seeking comment.\n    \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\nsomeone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\nMerrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\nbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\ndlrs per share.\"\n    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\nwhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\nGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\nprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\nyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\noperations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\nthe dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\nhas recently made two other acquisitions.\n    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\nsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\nCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\nGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,\nRJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston\nPurina Co <RAL>.\n    \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\nWall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\ncompany is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\nto resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\nconsenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\nsaid.\n   \n    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n\"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\ncalculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to\nbe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\nshareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\nthree and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\nGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\nagreement without any financing condition.

Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\nto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\nthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\nfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\neconomists said.\n    \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan\nof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\neconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\nthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\nin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\nas better gauges of economic growth.\n    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\nmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\n5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\n    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\nconcerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\ncould turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\n    \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\nmarket position?

{"title": "U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES", "body": "More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers\nfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes\nthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to other\ninterest rates.\n    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in\nyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers\ntrying to lock into cheap money.\n    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials\nsaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home\nmortgage business.\n    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They\nwere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a\nfew years ago.\n    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,\nmostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\nas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\nportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\ninduce them to retain their accounts.\n    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\nforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\nrates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n    \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\nsaid a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\nexplaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\noffering variable rate mortgages.\n    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\nhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\nconcede they are being forced to undercut each other still\nmore.\n    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\nthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\nNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\nnew business, officials at all three institutions said.\n    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\nbelow those on the variable rate loans.\n    \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\nrate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\nearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\nnew mortgage loans.\n    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\nloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\nmortgage product.\"\n    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\nrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\nexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n    \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\nthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\nof its 1986 volume.\n    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\noffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\nrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\nlender is earning an above average return on assets.\n    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\nthe benefit of cheap money.\n    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\nrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\nthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\nfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n    Young explained that the company had planned to protect\nitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\ncomplicated hedging instrument.\n    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\nand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\nsaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\nmortgages and hedge profitably.\n    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\nmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\nmeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\nand selling them to an investor.\n    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\nefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\nmortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\nagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\nover the past few years.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

(FECSA), a major utility, defaulted on two\nbillion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year.\n    Secretary of State for the Economy, Guillermo De la Dehesa,\ntold Reuters in an interview that a new government-inspired\ntariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each year\nwould guarantee the long term viability of the industry.\n    He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes\n(parliament) this summer, enabling tariff increases from next\nyear to be set under the new system.\n    De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of the\nscheme, known here as the \"Marco Estable\" (stable framework), but\nsaid future tariff increases would make up for the failure of\npast adjustments to cover rising costs.\n    \"The utility companies have a captive market and if they are\nassured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the best\nof all possible worlds to do business in,\" De la Dehesa said.\n    FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign and\nSpanish bankers who expressed fears that other utility\ncompanies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidence\nin the industry's future is restored.\n    Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts, with\nshort and medium term exposure of 4,377 billion pesetas at the\nend of last year. A significant proportion of it is in foreign\ncurrency, bankers say.\n    The new tariff plan, currently being discussed with\nrepresentatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers,\nwould shortly be presented to foreign creditors, De la Dehesa\nsaid.\n    FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when the\nstock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on the\ngrounds that it could not meet its debts.\n     \"FECSA was a special case,\" De la Dehesa said, \"but the banks\ntook fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utility\nsector. We really did not expect this.\"\n    Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been on\nthe strength of a government commitment made to international\nbankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support the\nindustry.\n    \"I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis of\ndeclarations by our energy authorities in London, they will\nhave all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system is\npassed into law,\" De la Dehesa said.\n     \"This is going to be a palpable fact, not just a\ndeclaration,\" he added.\n    De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence was\nrestored in the sector as a whole, FECSA's debt problems would\nbe quickly solved.\n    A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA's\nforeign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona on\nTuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailing\nutility's debt.\n    FECSA's General Manager, Jose Zaforteza, told Reuters he\nthought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved by\nthe new tariff proposals.\n    \"You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electrical\nutility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to cover\nyour costs,\" Zaforteza said.\n    The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a U.S. Bank\nwhich has lent money to FECSA said there would be little\nsignificant progress in the rescheduling talks until details of\nthe tariff proposals were known.\n    \"We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to pay\nits debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be,\" he\nsaid.\n    \"If you make annual increases over a period of years of\nfour, five or six pct, in each case it's a completely different\nball game,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

That is its\nhighest level since January 1986.\n    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\noil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\nbe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\nagreement may only need a slight review.\n    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\nof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\na desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\n    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\nafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\ntension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\nshould begin easing.\n    \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\nto in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\nvice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\nbarrels in the fourth quarter.\n    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\nfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\nAlgeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\nreduction in output.\n    \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\ntrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\nOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\nBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\nas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n    \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\nofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\ncommitted to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\nin September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\nfourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\nday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\nbarrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\nof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\nmeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\noffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\nthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\nproducers receive less money for their oil.\n    \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\nsaid Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n    \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\nproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\nas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\ndlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\nsaid.\n    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n    \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\nGulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\nSecurites.\n    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\nregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\nis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\nU.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n    \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\nlike this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\ncould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "FURTHER US DEFENSE WRITEOFFS LIKELY, ANALYSTS SAY", "body": "The tug-of-war over who pays to develop\nnew weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead\nto more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.\n    Singer Co <SMF> and Northrop Corp <NOC> recently announced\nplanned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major\ndefense programs under fixed-price government contracts.\n    \"It's a case of companies paying for things that in a\ndifferent environment the Defense Department would have paid\nfor,\" said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities\nCorp.\n    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increased\ncompetitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked\ncontractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons\nprograms.\n    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors\nbut have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,\nanalysts said.\n    \"It's a stricter environment,\" said Anthony Hatch of Argus\nResearch Corp. \"Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and\nmore of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to\ncome.\"\n    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, the\nanalysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are the\nAdvanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,\nhigh-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. Air\nForce, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter\nExperimental, LHX, under development for the Army.\n    Other programs may also be affected, they said.\n    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced\nfighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,\nanalysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing for\na contract to develop a prototype ATF.\n    Lockheed Corp <LK>, General Dynamics Corp <GD> and Boeing\nCo <BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp <NOC>\nand McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> on ATF.\n    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are\nBell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc <TXT>, coupled with\nMcDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's <UTX>\nSikorsky paired with Boeing.\n    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnell\nDouglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,\nand a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be\nmade by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.\n    Under the government's new procedures, contractors can\nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  \ntypically recoup their investments during production.\n    But now the government sometimes awards production to a\nsecond contractor who did not develop the system. General\nElectric Co <GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine for\nthe Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of\nF404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.\n    Such tactics have increased competition but the government\nnow risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,\nsaid Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.\n    \"Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worst\nenemies. They were not cost efficient,\" LaTronica said. \"Now\nDOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other\nway that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as\na national resource.\"\n    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in\nrecent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products\nthan it imported, he noted.\n    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in\ngovernment procurement may be coming.\n    \"I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,\"\nsaid John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.\n    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe\nthe Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and\nperhaps start paying more development money.\n    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry\ndespite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,\nsaid, \"There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing\npsychology of the last few years is starting to shift.\"\n    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently\nsuggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get\nsole production of the plane for a specified time.\n    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,\nBoeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to\ndevelop the prototype.\n    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is\nthat companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but\ninstead will wait for a second source production award.\n    \"But it may take a company going bust to really change\npeople's thinking,\" LaTronica said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The study advocated reduction of\ncholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.\n    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry\nanalysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug\ntherapy will gain wider acceptance.\n    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of\nSanford C. Bernstein said \"the culture can shift in terms of\ndrug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally\nalter their diets\".\n    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600\nmln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,\nanalysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs\nannually in about next five years.\n    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low\ncholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and\ncolestipol, a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977.\n    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say\nthe new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. \"Niacin leads to\ntremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach\nupset,\" Crossen said.\n    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to\n30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. \"It isn't fun\nto take,\" Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks\nrestricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under\n10 mln dlrs a year.\n    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have\nlittle side effects because they target a key factor in the\nbody's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the\nliver.\n   \n    \"Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather\nvariable,\" said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice\npresident at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a\nclear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.\n    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a\ntablet form swallowed once or twice a day.\n    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an\nadvisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this\nyear and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late\nsummer or fall.\n    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for\nregulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,\nSanders said.\n    Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also\nhave cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,\nbut only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of\ncholesterol inhibitors.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

They lost a lot of\nmoney in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want\nto cut their losses while they can,\" said Keith Brown, banking\nanalyst at Greenwell Montagu.\n    \"The question now is how many other gilt market makers will\nface a similar fate,\" one senior gilt market maker said.\n    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. \"They are\nthe first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out\nof eurobond market making altogether,\" said a member of the\nAssociation of International Bond Dealers London staff.\n    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds\nhad frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond\noperations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.\n    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearing\nbank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from the\ngilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London\nStock Exchange in October.\n    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L>, the fourth\nlargest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equities\non the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. It\ncontinues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a prepared\nstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the\nbank had a \"relatively small position in these two overcrowded\nmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to\nopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders\ninvestment.\"\n    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term\nsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.\n    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the\ndecision was forward looking and followed a \"strategic review\" of\nthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. \"We decided the\nreturn just was not attractive,\" he said.\n    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board\nthis morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration\nfor some time.\n    He denied that the move was a \"reaction to events in the\ntrading room\" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt\noperations were not profitable in the early stages of the new\nmarket.\n    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds\nMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he\nsaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.\nFor all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln\nstg. \"Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses,\" Brown\nsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the\nbank's exposure to Latin America.\n    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase\ntheir provisions against bad loans to third world countries\nsince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its\nprovisions in mid-May.\n    National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>, the largest of the\nclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow\nCiticorp's <CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was\nadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.\n    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America\nafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.\n    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore\ndenied that today's action had any connection. \"It is totally\nunrelated,\" he said.\n    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the\nannouncement was made. But market participants were\ndumbfounded.\n    \"We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the\nannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I\nstill have job,\" said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be\nidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it\ncould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other\nparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these\nmarkets was relatively small, other market participants,\nparticularly in gilts, were unnerved.\n    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes\nduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have\nbeen battered by the lack of investor participation, following\nthe June 11 U.K. general election.\n    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a\nreturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy\ndemand. These expectations have failed to be met and both\nmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.\n    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was\nexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials\nhave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.\n    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems\nfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its\nown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a\nbroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted\nseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.\n    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed\ndoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27\nmarket makers, even if turnover increased substantially.\n    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that\nsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

A year earlier\nit bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, for\nabout 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co <F> has added First Nationwide\nSavings as part of a move into financial services.\n    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated its\ninterest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp <LK> once rumored as a\npossible target.\n    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according to\nanalysts.

Ford has been \"a little bit of a\nlaggard\" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to\nsome investors.\n    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,\nwhen it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.\n    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for\nElectrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay\nfor the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of\n191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.\n    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the\nRichardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying\nAmerican Motors Corp <AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal\nset to close later this year.\n    \"Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a\nyear or more and will absorb a lot of debt,\" Kirnan said,\nmaking them the most heavily leveraged auto company.\n    But other analysts said the relative small size of\nElectrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.\n    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed\nsignificantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln\ndlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.\n    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's\nsales were to the military.\n    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,\nChrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the\nautomobile business.\n    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that\nGulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,\ncomposites and aerodynamic design. \"Those will all be important\ntechnologies for winning in the automobile business in the\n1990s,\" Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should add\nsignificantly to the electronics area, he said.\n    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by\none-time items and but should recover this year.\n    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for\nElectrospace.\n    \"They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or\nmore professional people.
