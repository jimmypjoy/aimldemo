In 1609, Henry Hudson, seeking an alternate route to East Asia, anchored his small vessel Halve Maen (English: Half Moon) at Sandy Hook, Harsimus Cove and Weehawken Cove, and elsewhere along what was later named the North River. After spending nine days surveying the area and meeting its inhabitants, he sailed as far north as Albany. The contemporary flag of the city is a variation on the Prince\\'s Flag from the Netherlands. The stripes are blue, white and yellow, with the center of the flag showing the city seal, depicting Hudson\\'s ship, the Half Moon, and other modern vessels.\\nBy 1621, the Dutch West India Company was organized to manage this new territory and in June 1623, New Netherland became a Dutch province, with headquarters in New Amsterdam. Michael Reyniersz Pauw received a land grant as patroon on the condition that he would establish a settlement of not fewer than fifty persons within four years. He chose the west bank of the Hudson River and purchased the land from the Lenape. This grant is dated November 22, 1630, and is the earliest known conveyance for what are now Hoboken and Jersey City. Pauw, however, was an absentee landlord who neglected to populate the area and was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. That year, a house was built at Communipaw for Jan Evertsen Bout, superintendent of the colony, which had been named Pavonia (the Latinized form of Pauw\\'s name, which means \"peacock\"). Shortly after, another house was built at Harsimus Cove and became the home of Cornelius Van Vorst, who had succeeded Bout as superintendent, and whose family would become influential in the development of the city. Relations with the Lenape deteriorated, in part because of the colonialist\\'s mismanagement and misunderstanding of the indigenous people, and led to series of raids and reprisals and the virtual destruction of the settlement on the west bank. During Kieft\\'s War, approximately eighty Lenapes were killed by the Dutch in a massacre at Pavonia on the night of February 25, 1643.\\nScattered communities of farmsteads characterized the Dutch settlements at Pavonia: Communipaw, Harsimus, Paulus Hook, Hoebuck, Awiehaken, Pamrapo, and other lands \"behind Kill van Kull\". The village of Bergen (located inside a palisaded garrison) was established on what is now Bergen Squ'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'title': 'New Jersey Devils', 'summary': \"The New Jersey Devils are a professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey. The Devils compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974. The Scouts moved to Denver in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and took their current name, which is derived from the legendary Jersey Devil creature. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed Continental Airlines Arena). Before the 2007–08 season, the team moved to Prudential Center in Newark. The Devils are owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2013.\\nThe franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the Stanley Cup playoffs and never finished higher than fifth in their division, which had six teams at the time. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of the president and general manager Lou Lamoriello in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992–93 to 2009–10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009–10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013.

The Devils compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference. The club was founded as the Kansas City Scouts in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1974. The Scouts moved to Denver in 1976 and became the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved to East Rutherford, New Jersey, and took their current name, which is derived from the legendary Jersey Devil creature. For their first 25 seasons in New Jersey, the Devils were based at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford and played their home games at Brendan Byrne Arena (later renamed Continental Airlines Arena). Before the 2007–08 season, the team moved to Prudential Center in Newark. The Devils are owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer acquiring the team in 2013.\\nThe franchise was poor to mediocre in the eight years before moving to New Jersey, a pattern that continued during the first five years in New Jersey as they failed to make the Stanley Cup playoffs and never finished higher than fifth in their division, which had six teams at the time. Their fortunes began to turn around following the hiring of the president and general manager Lou Lamoriello in 1987. Under Lamoriello's stewardship, the Devils made the playoffs all but three times between 1988 and 2012, including 13 berths in a row from 1997 to 2010, and finished with a winning record every season from 1992–93 to 2009–10. They have won the Atlantic Division regular season title nine times, most recently in 2009–10, before transferring to the newly created Metropolitan Division as part of the NHL's realignment in 2013.

Thompson. The new team was officially named the Scouts in reference to Cyrus E. Dallin's statue of the same name which stands in that city's Penn Valley Park. In the team's inaugural season, 1974–75, the Scouts were forced to wait until the ninth game to play in Kansas City's Kemper Arena, and did not post a win until beating the Washington Capitals, their expansion brethren, in their tenth contest. With 41 points in their inaugural season, the Scouts finished last in the Smythe Division; only the Capitals had fewer points in the NHL. Kansas City fell to 36 points the following season, and had a 27-game win-less streak, three short of the NHL record, which was set when the 1980–81 Winnipeg Jets went 30 games without a win.

It was conceived as a theocratic assembly of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came with different ideas. On October 31, 1693, it was organized as a New Jersey township based on the Newark Tract, which was first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a royal charter on April 27, 1713. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by the New Jersey Legislature\\'s Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey\\'s initial group of 104 townships. During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark\\'s Vailsburg.\\nThe name of the city is thought to derive from Newark-on-Trent, England, because of the influence of the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire. But Pierson is also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at hand should be named \"New Ark\" for \"New Ark of the Covenant\" and some of the colonists saw it as \"New-Work\", the settlers\\' new work with God. Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references to the name \"New Ark\" are found in preserved letters wr'),\n",

New Jersey\\'s first counties were created as administrative districts within each province, with East Jersey split in 1675 into Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Monmouth counties, while West Jersey\\'s initial counties of Burlington and Salem date to 1681. The most recent county created in New Jersey is Union County, created in 1857 and named after the union of the United States when the Civil War was imminent. New Jersey\\'s county names derive from several sources, though most of its counties are named after place names in England and prominent leaders in the colonial and revolutionary periods.

Sims, establishing the one man, one vote principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The court ruled unanimously that the existing system was unconstitutional, ordered that interim measures be established by statute for the 1965 legislative elections, and ordered that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with \"one man, one vote\" requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The senate unilaterally—by internal rule, not by statute—enacted a proposal whereby each senator\\'s vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented,  under which Cape May County\\'s senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1 votes, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it was unconstitutional for the senate to adopt a weighted voting system unilaterally. In 1966, the constitution was amended to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assembly members, without relation to county boundaries.\\n\\n\\n== FIPS code ==\\n\\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, used by the United States government to uniquely identify counties, is provided with each entry.

The first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was called Prigmore's Swamp (1681–1697), then known as Inian's Ferry (1691–1714). In 1714, the settlement was given the name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (Brunswick in Low German), in the state of Lower Saxony, now located in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League and was an administrative seat for the Duchy of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\\n\\n\\n=== Colonial and Early American periods ===\\nCentrally located between New York City and Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the King's Highway and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders.

The NJDOT defines three types of jughandles in its design manual. \"Type A\" is the standard forward jughandle that intersects with a cross street. With forward ramps, all turning traffic (right and left) exit onto a jughandle ramp to the right. \"Type B\" is a variant with no cross-street intersected by the jughandle; it curves 90 degrees left to meet the main street, and is only used at a \"T\" intersection or a U-turn. \"Type C\" is the standard reverse jughandle; left-turning vehicles pass through the intersection and enter a ramp that loops roughly 270 degrees. Jughandles can cause motorist confusion because turning setups are inconsistent among intersections, and such an alignment is unfamiliar to motorists outside of the northeastern United States.\\n\\n\\n==== Traffic circles ====\\n\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, traffic circles were built throughout the state because they were viewed as an efficient way to move traffic through three or more intersecting roads.

Much like the president of the United States, the governor appoints the entire cabinet, subject to confirmation by the New Jersey Senate. More importantly, under the New Jersey constitution, the governor appoints all superior court judges and county prosecutors, although this is done with strong consideration of the preferences of the individual state senators who represent the district where vacancies arise.

The town was not named for Queen Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of New Jersey. She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital of New Jersey.\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Elizabethtown was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and Staten Island, culminating in the Battle of Springfield which decisively defeated British attempts to gain New Jersey.

In 1633, David Pietersen De Vries, a Dutch commander, was sailing up the Delaware River when he came across Natives in control of the fort. The settlers that had been left at the fort had decided to return to New Amsterdam (Today Manhattan, New York). Wouter van Twiller, Governor of New Netherland, restored Fort Nassau. He was accused of extravagant spending in the fort\\'s reconstruction. The settlement subsequently sparked competition from European Settlers over control of the fur trade in the area.  The fort was used by the Dutch until around 1650 or 1651 when it was decided that it was far to up the river to be of any value. The buildings and stockades were demolished and Wouter van Twiller assigned Arent Corssen to find a place for another fort. \\nThe British first had a pressence in the area in 1634.

The surrender of Fort Amsterdam in September 1664 gave control over the entire Mid-Atlantic region to the English as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The English justified the seizure by claiming that John Cabot, an Italian under the sponsorship of the English King Henry VII, had been the first to discover the place, but it was probably to assert control over the profitable North Atlantic trade. Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant, unable to rouse a military defense, relinquished control of the colony and was able in the articles of transfer to secure guarantees for property rights, laws of inheritance, and freedom of religion. After the surrender, Richard Nicolls took the position as deputy-governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland, including those settlements on the west side of the North River (Hudson River) known as Bergen and those along the Delaware River that had been New Sweden.\\n\\n\\n== Proprietary government ==\\n\\nIn March 1664, King Charles II granted his brother, James, the Duke of York, a Royal colony that covered New Netherlands and present-day Maine. This charter also included parts of present-day Massachusetts, which conflicted with that colony's charter. The charter allowed James traditional propriety rights and imposed few restrictions upon his powers. In general terms, the charter was equivalent to a conveyance of land conferring on him the right of possession, control, and government, subject only to the limitation that the government must be consistent with the laws of England. The Duke of York never visited his colony and exercised little direct control of it. He elected to administer his government through governors, councils, and other officers appointed by himself. No provision was made for an elected assembly.\\n\\nLater in 1664, the Duke of York gave the part of his new possessions between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the island of Jersey, Carteret's ancestral home. The other section of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English lords proprietors of New Jersey. The two proprietors of New Jersey attempted to attract more settlers to move to the province by granting sections of lands to settlers and by passing the Concession and Agreement, a 1665 document that granted religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; under the British government, there was no such religious freedom as the Church of England was the state church. In return for the land, the settlers were supposed to pay annual fees known as quit-rents.\\nIn 1665, Philip Carteret became the first governor of New Jersey, appointed by the two proprietors. He selected Elizabeth as the capital of New Jersey. Immediately, Carteret issued several additional grants of land to landowners. Towns were started and charters granted to Newark (1666), Piscataway (1666), Bergen (1668), Middletown (1693), Woodbridge (1669), and Shrewsbury.\\nThe i\"),\n",

The township is the home of Montclair State University, the state\\'s second-largest university.\\nAs of the 2020 United States census, the township\\'s population was 40,921, an increase of 3,252 (+8.6%) from the 2010 census count of 37,669, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,308 (−3.4%) from the 38,977 counted in the 2000 census. As of 2010, it was the 60th-most-populous municipality in New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nMontclair was initially formed as a township on April 15, 1868, from portions of Bloomfield Township, so that a second railroad could be built to Montclair. After a referendum held on February 21, 1894, Montclair was reincorporated as a town, effective February 24, 1894. It derives its name from the French mont clair, meaning \"clear mountain\" or \"bright mountain.\"\\nIn 1980, after multiple protests filed by Montclair officials regarding inequities built into the federal revenue-sharing system, Montclair passed a referendum changing its name to the \"Township of Montclair,\" becoming the third of more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships to take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.\\nBefore cannabis was legalized for sale for both medical and recreational use in 2022, the state\\'s first marijuana dispensary opened in Montclair in December 2012, joining Bellmawr, Cranbury, Egg Harbor Township, and Woodbridge Township as one of the five municipalities that had authorized the sale of medical cannabis.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 6.25 square miles (16.17 km2), including 6.24 square miles (16.16 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.02 km2) of water (0.11%).\\nMontclair is on the east side of the First Mountain of the Watchung Mountains. Some higher locations in the township provide excellent views of the surrounding area and of the New York City skyline about 12 miles (19 km) away.\\nNamed localities in the township include Church Street, Frog Hollow, South End, Upper Montclair, and Watchung Plaza.\\nMontclair is split between two ZIP Codes. The central and southern parts of the township are designated 07042. Upper Montclair lies north of Watchung Avenue and has a separate ZIP code, 07043. Because the ZIP codes do not exactly match municipal boundaries, a few homes near the borders with neighboring towns fall into the ZIP codes for those communities. A few homes in some adjoining municipalities use one of the two ZIP codes assigned to Montclair, as does HackensackUMC Mountainside (07042, formerly known as Mountainside Hospital), whose campus straddles the border with Glen Ridge. Small areas in the southeast of the township fall into the Glen Ridge ZIP code 07028.\\nSeveral streams flow eastward through Montclair: Toney\\'s Brook in the center, Nishuane Brook in the southeast, Wigwam Brook in the southwest, Pearl Brook in the northwest, and Yantacaw Brook in the northeast—all in the Passaic River watershed. Yantacaw and Toney\\'s brooks are dammed in parks to create ponds. Wigwam, Nishuane, and Toney\\'s brooks flow into the Second River, and the others flow into the Third River. Montclair lies just north of the northernmost extent of the Rahway River watershed.\\nMontclair borders the municipalities of Bloomfield, Cedar Grove, Glen Ridge, Orange, Verona, and West Orange in Essex County; and Clifton and Little Falls in Passaic County.\\nThe southern border of Montclair is a straight line between Eagle Rock, on the ridge of the First Watchung Mountain, and the point where Orange Road begins at the foot of Ridgewood Avenue.

The land was known as the Lenapehoking. The Dutch claimed the land as New Netherlands, followed by the British as the Province of New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n=== Establishment ===\\nIn 1791, Alexander Hamilton (1755/57–1804), first United States Secretary of the Treasury,  helped found the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), which helped encourage the harnessing of energy from the Great Falls of the Passaic River to secure economic independence from British manufacturers. The society founded Paterson, which became the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. Paterson was named for William Paterson, statesman, signer of the Constitution and Governor of New Jersey, who signed the 1792 charter that established the Town of Paterson.\\nArchitect, engineer, and city planner Pierre L\\'Enfant (1754–1825), who had earlier developed the initial plans for Washington, D.C., was the first planner for the S.U.M. project. His plan proposed to harness the power of the Great Falls through a channel in the rock and an aqueduct. The society\\'s directors felt he was taking too long and was over budget, and he was replaced by Peter Colt, who used a less complicated reservoir system to get the water flowing to factories in 1794. Eventually, Colt\\'s system developed some problems and a scheme resembling L\\'Enfant\\'s original plan was used after 1846.\\nPaterson was originally formed as a township from portions of Acquackanonk Township on April 11, 1831, while the area was still part of Essex County. It became part of the newly created Passaic County on February 7, 1837, and was incorporated as a city on April 14, 1851, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The city was reincorporated on March 14, 1861.\\n\\n\\n=== Industrial growth ===\\nThe 77-foot-high (23 m) Great Falls and a system of water raceways that harnessed the falls\\' power provided power for the mills in the area until 1914 and fostered growth of the city. The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and, later, the firearms, silk, and railroad locomotive manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 19th century, silk production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of Paterson\\'s most prosperous period, earning it the nickname \"Silk City.\"\\nIn 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in Paterson, but within a few years he moved his business to Hartford, Connecticut. Later in the 19th century, Paterson was the site of early experiments with submarines by Irish-American inventor John Philip Holland. Two of Holland\\'s early models—one found at the bottom of the Passaic River—are on display in the Paterson Museum, housed in the former Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works near the Passaic Falls.\\nBehind Newark and New York, the brewing industry was booming in Paterson in'),\n",

Like nearby Union Hill, it was subdivided and lots were sold mostly to Germans. The company ran two ferries, the Hultz and the Flora, which crossed the Hudson from the landings at the foot of Bulls Ferry Road, Pleasant Valley, Fort Lee, and Spring Street in Manhattan.\\nGuttenberg was formed as a town on March 9, 1859, from portions of North Bergen Township, but remained as a part of the township that was not fully independent. Guttenberg became part of Union Township when it was formed on February 28, 1861, and became fully independent as of April 1, 1878. The municipality takes its name from Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the European version of the printing press, though other sources indicate that the name derives from \"good village\" in German.\\nGalaxy Towers, developed by Prudential Insurance Company, were built in the late 1970s on Boulevard East. The three octagonal skyscrapers rise 415 feet (126 m) and contain 1,075 apartments.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\nGuttenberg is located atop the Hudson Palisades, south of Woodcliff and the Racetrack Section in North Bergen and north of West New York. To the east the town shares a border the New York City borough of Manhattan (Upper West Side) in the Hudson River. Its western border is Kennedy Boulevard. Bergenline Avenue, the commercial corridor of North Hudson, runs north and south through the town, and is the heart of \"Havana on the Hudson\".\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 0.24 square miles (0.62 km2), including 0.19 square miles (0.50 km2) of land and 0.05 square miles (0.12 km2) of water (20.00%). The town is four blocks long, and takes less than a minute to drive through.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2010 census ===\\nThe 2010 United States census counted 11,176 people, 4,473 households, and 2,684 families in the town. The population density was 57,116.0 per square mile (22,052.6/km2). There were 4,839 housing units at an average density of 24,730.2 per square mile (9,548.4/km2). The racial makeup was 67.44% (7,537) White, 4.80% (537) Black or African American, 0.91% (102) Native American, 7.32% (818) Asian, 0.04% (4) Pacific Islander, 14.25% (1,593) from other races, and 5.23% (585) from two or more races.

Its total area of the state is 8,729 square miles (22,610 km2), of which  1,304 square miles (3,380 km2) is water, and 7,425 square miles (19,230 km2) is land. New Jersey spans 70 miles (110 km) at its widest, and 166 miles (267 km) in length. Much of the state's population live within 50 miles of New York City or Philadelphia due to the size and shape of the state.\\nNew Jersey, which ranks eleventh in the nation in terms of population with 8,791,894 people, making it the most densely populated state in the United States, with 1,189 inhabitants per square mile (459/km2). However, while this may offer the impression that New Jersey is entirely urban or suburban, it is not. Large swaths of South Jersey are occupied by the Pinelands National Reserve, over 1.1 million acres (4,500 km2) in size, located in Atlantic County, Burlington County, and Ocean County. Northwestern and southern New Jersey are  also extremely rural due to the mountainous and hilly terrain of the Ridge and Valley region. For example, Walpack Township in Sussex County has a population of 7 and an area of 26 square miles (67 km2), and Washington Township in Burlington County has a population of under 700 while occupying 104.81 square miles (271.46 km^2)\\n\\n\\n== Political and cultural geography ==\\n\\nThe State of New Jersey is divided into 21 counties, which combined, contain a total of 566 municipalities. New Jersey municipalities have a strong tradition of independent home rule. Rural municipalities tend to lean more conservative, while suburban and urban municipalities lean more liberal, similar to the national trend. \\n\\nNew Jersey is commonly divided into the cultural regions of North Jersey, Central Jersey and South Jersey. Many residents debate about whether Central Jersey actually exists or not, but this debate was resolved by Governor Phil Murphy's signing of a law that declared Central Jersey to be made up of Middlesex, Union, Mercer, Somerset, and Hunterdon counties. \\nNorth Jersey comprises Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Morris, Sussex, and Warren Counties, while Central Jersey is made up of Middlesex, Union, Mercer, Somerset, and\"),\n",

Belleville was originally incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1839, from portions of Bloomfield. Portions of the township were taken to create Woodside Township (March 24, 1869, now defunct) and Franklin Township (February 18, 1874, now known as Nutley). The independent municipality of Belleville city was created within the township on March 27, 1874, and was dissolved on February 22, 1876. On November 16, 1910, Belleville was reincorporated as a town, based on the results of a referendum held eight days earlier.\\nIn 1870, Belleville became the first city on the East Coast of the United States with a Chinatown. While much of the country (especially the Western states) had strong anti-Chinese sentiment, the town welcomed a group of Chinese workers from the West Coast who had been workers on building the Central Pacific Railroad. This group of people eventually formed the basis for Chinatowns in Newark and New York City.\\nIn 1981, the town was one of seven Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining four municipalities that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.\\nFrankie Valli and the band The Four Seasons formed in Belleville, as did The Delicates, the late-1950s and early-1960s girl group made up of Denise Ferri, Arleen Lanzotti and Peggy Santiglia.\\nIn 1994, Congress passed a resolution recognizing Belleville as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the United States.\\n\\n\\n== Geography ==\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 3.37 square miles (8.71 km2), including 3.30 square miles (8.54 km2) of land and 0.07 square miles (0.18 km2) of water (2.05%).\\nSilver Lake (2010 total population of 4,243) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) defined by the United States Census Bureau as of the 2010 Census that is split between Belleville (with 3,769 of the CDP\\'s residents) and Bloomfield (474 of the total).\\nOther unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Belwood, Big Tree and Soho.\\nThe Second River forms much of the border between Belleville and Newark as it runs through Branch Brook Park.\\nThe township of Belleville has given itself the nickname the Cherry Blossom Capital of America, with an annual display that is larger than the famed Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C., site of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.\\nThe township borders the municipalities of Bloomfield, Newark and Nutley in Essex County; Lyndhurst and North Arlington in Bergen County; and Kearny in Hudson County.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2020 census ===\\n\\n\\n=== 2010 census ===\\nThe 2010 United States census counted 35,926 people, 13,395 households, and 9,001 families in the township.

To celebrate the band\\'s 30th anniversary in 2014, the album was repackaged with bonus tracks.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nThe album was recorded very shortly after the Slippery When Wet Tour, because the band wanted to prove that they were not just going to be a one hit wonder. The album was initially planned to be a double album; however, this idea was rejected by the record label because they were skeptical about the higher price point and decided they would only release a single album. One working title for the album was Sons of Beaches, which alluded to the title of Slippery When Wet.\\n\\n\\n== Recording and production ==\\nThe album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn like its predecessor and recorded at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It marked the final collaboration between Bon Jovi and producer Bruce Fairbairn.\\nWhen the Slippery When Wet Tour ended in October 1987, the band were inactive for about three to four weeks. Then Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora began making demos for 17 songs which would make up the first batch of songs written for the album. However, they began to feel a high level of pressure because they did not feel as though they had \"the amazing song\". Jon Bon Jovi said that \"I really wanted to do it again, not for monetary reasons—I have plenty of money—but it was such an amazing feeling to have done what we\\'ve done. There was a real fear of not being able to write \\'You Give Love a Bad Name\\' again.\" Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora sat together and wrote the song \"Love Is War\" but Jon Bon Jovi wanted to write a song that would prove to be just as successful as \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" so desperately that it came out with exactly the same chord progression. They later started on the second batch of songs and they wrote \"Bad Medicine\" and \"Born to Be My Baby\" with Desmond Child. \"Born to Be My Baby\" was originally recorded acoustically, however the producer Bruce Fairbairn persuaded them to re-record it with electric instruments in a much more metal style. Jon Bon Jovi has since said that he believed the song would have made number one on the charts if it had been released in its original form. This song has a similar theme to \"Livin\\' on a Prayer\", as it is about a young working class couple struggling to make ends meet.\\nAlthough the glossy production and anthems from Slippery When Wet remained, the band wished to show a level of diversity on the album. The album is much more experimental with a long, atmosphere-building intro on \"Lay Your Hands on Me\", harmonica and organ duels on \"Homebound Train\" and a flamenco guitar intro on \"Wild Is the Wind\". \"Ride Cowboy Ride\" is a short song functioning as an introduction to \"Stick to Your Guns\" and was recorded in mono. The song is credited to \"Captain Kidd and King of Swing\", the nicknames of Bon Jovi and Sambora.\\n\"Love for S')]"

These electrons have a property called spin, which is like a tiny spinning top. When many of these spinning electrons are moving in the same direction, they create a magnetic field around the magnet.\\n\\nThe magnetic field is an invisible force that extends out from the magnet in all directions. When another magnet or certain metals, such as iron, come into contact with this magnetic field, they can feel the force and either attract or repel each other. This is why magnets can stick to metal objects or each other.\\n\\nBut why do some magnets attract and others repel? This depends on the orientation of the magnetic field. Just like how a compass needle always points north because of the Earth's magnetic field, magnets also have a north and south pole. These poles can either attract or repel each other depending on their orientation. Opposite poles, north and south, attract each other, while like poles, either both north or both south, repel each other.\\n\\nSo you can think of magnets as tiny bar magnets with their own north and south poles. And when you bring two magnets together, their magnetic fields interact with each other, causing them to either\""

      "Question: Explain the implications of quantum computing.     Classified as: answer: this question is complex, as the implications of quantum computing are extensive and still being explored. some potential implications include the ability to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, the potential to simulate quantum systems, and the potential for significant advances in areas such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning. however, there are also challenges associated with building and programming quantum computers, and it is still an open question how quantum computers will be used in practice.\n",
      "Clarification: \n",
      "\n",
      "To answer the complex question fully, let me first provide a brief explanation of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a type of computing technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. In classical computing, data is stored and processed in bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. In quantum computing, data is stored and processed in quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time, a property known as superposition. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let me explain the implications of quantum computing:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Faster Solutions for Complex Problems: Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computing. For example, it can be used to factor large numbers, which is important in cryptography and can be done exponentially faster on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. It can also be used to simulate complex chemical reactions, which can help in the development of new drugs and materials.\n",
      "2. New Algorithms: Quantum computing also enables new algorithms that cannot be implemented on classical computers. For example, Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases can be implemented much faster on a quantum computer than on a classical computer.\n",
      "3. Quantum Supremacy: Quantum computing also has the potential to achieve quantum supremacy, which means solving a problem that is intractable on a classical computer but can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer. This was demonstrated by Google in 2019 with their Quantum Supremacy experiment, which solved a problem that would take the world's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to solve, but was solved by Google's quantum computer in just a few minutes.\n",
      "4. Advancements in AI and Machine Learning: Quantum computing can also be used to advance artificial intelligence and machine learning. For example, quantum machine learning algorithms can be used to process large amounts of data more efficiently than classical machine learning algorithms, and quantum neural networks can be used to develop more accurate and powerful AI models.\n",
      "5. Ethical and Societal Implications: Quantum computing also raises ethical and societal implications. For example, it could lead to new cybersecurity threats, as quantum computers could potentially break the encryption used to secure sensitive data. It could also lead to job displacement in industries that\n"
