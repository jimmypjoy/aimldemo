The price gyrations have\ncombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\nvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\nlawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\ntakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\nsteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\nexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\nfor an international securities marketplace in which trading\noccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\nopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\nU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\ndisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\neliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\nspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\nreview of hostile corporate takeovers.\n    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\ninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\nthe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n    In line with the views of other top administration\nofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\nbattles over new federal regulations.\n    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\ntrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\ntopped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\nadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\nRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\nlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\nfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\nagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n    The agency is one of the few in the government that\nactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\nfew years because of fees it charges public companies,\ninvestment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\nmeaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\npresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\nfor policy differences alone.\n    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\npolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\neach year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\nto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\nin large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\nmarket manipulations by large investment firms.\n    The agency requires public companies and investment\nvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\ntheir financial condition and to disclose changes in their\ncondition any time they issue new securities.\n    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\nregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\nit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\nmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\nbecome the nation's 35th president.\n    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\nfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\nfirst term and was Reagan's director of the Central\nIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

The consumer price\nindex rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive\nmonth on month increase.\n    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,\nwhich erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising\nprices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.\n    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut\nin Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now\ndied, discouraging investors, brokers said.\n    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer\na downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.\n    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may\nalso firm, brokers said. \"I have never been able to justify this\nbecause it should mean that the cost of importing rises,\" said a\nbroker at Yamaichi Securities Co. \"It just always happens.\"\n    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally\nif the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue\nchip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making\nthem look less attractive, brokers said.\n    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the\nmarket index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp\ndown rising capital outflows into dollar investments from\nJapan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.\n    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the\nbalance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower\ndollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand\nfor American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers\nsaid.\n    \"If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a\nfew exporters,\" said one foreign broker.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

The ceilings were to back\nup its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was\ncontemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spot\nprices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's Brent\nBlend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.\n    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this\nmorning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35\ndlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.\n    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly\nto news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies\nlater in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onset\nof the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spot\nprices.\n    \"There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth\nquarters of this year\" one trader said. \"In the past three months\nwe have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from the\nU.S., And I expect to see even higher prices\" he added.\n    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson\nin London, agreed.\n    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious\nin setting the new output ceilings. \"There is now a great chance\nthat Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next\nmonth,\" he said.\n    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,\nsaid over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas\nIntermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the\nyear from just over 20 dlrs now.\n    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of\n80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brent\nhas held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.\n    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by some\nOPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.\n    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement\nbecause other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand\nfor the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.\n    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd above\nits assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further\n500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in\nSeptember.\n    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa\nal-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be\nwell above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

IBM\nsaid last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and\nother software developers are skeptical, since delays in major\nnew software products are commonplace.\n    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be\nhindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors\nalike, who would prefer to keep making products that work with\ntried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, software\nanalyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.\n    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, has\nalready said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq\npresident Rod Canion said recently their will be no \"automatic\nmass migration\" to OS/2. \"(Advanced MS-DOS) applications will\ncontinue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2\nwill supply long after it becomes available,\" he said.\n    Cubbage acknowledged that \"it will probably be a year or\nmore before any really useful applications are available for\nOS-2,\" creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. \"But\nthere comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to\nyou,\" he said.\n    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the\ncomputer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new\ncomputers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's\nfast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the\nsagging sales of the personal computer industry and already\ngave a big boost to IBM.\n    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were\nshipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM\nexpect record pc sales ths year as a result.\n    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since\nthe full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped\nuntil a new operating system or other high level software is\navailable, analysts said.\n    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,\nor tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any\nslowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long\nstrived for.\n    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in\nparticular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking\nprogram, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.\n    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced\nversion of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in\nSeptember and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of\n100 dlrs and 300 dlrs.

{"title": "CANADA SETS OFF ITS OWN BIG BANG", "body": "stock\nmarket deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadian\nsecurities industry sets off its own fireworks.\n    Some companies are quickly taking advantage of\nderegulation, but more significant moves are likely to be a\nyear or more down the road, analysts say.\n    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond\ntrading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which they\nhave experience under the old rules that allowed them to\nprovide government debt financing and advisory services.\n    \"When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,\"\nsaid Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. \"Then they will eventually\njust start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' price\ncomes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too.\"\n    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage\nhouses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'\nbusinesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open\ncompetition.\n    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed \"Little Bang,\" will\nallow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions\nto set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.\n    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own\nsecurities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a\nCanadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100\npct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently\nown no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.\n    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by\nJune 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by\nforeign and domestic financial giants.\n    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a\nswirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation\nfever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to\nfour times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,\nanalysts said.\n    \"I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower\ntheir asking prices,\" said financial services analyst Jeff\nCarney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated\ntalks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.\n    \"I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch\naway from Burns Fry,\" added Carney. \"It is just a lot of money.\nWhen your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult\nto pay that amount of cash.\"\n    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was\nuncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were\nissued and approved only in mid-June.\n    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have\nfocused their deregulation strategy on planning their own\nCanadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock\nExchange, Canada's largest equities market.\n    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.\nLtd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.\nrecently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United\nStates investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs\nand Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.\n    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms\ninclude agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\nto raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10\npct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a\nminority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.\n    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign\nacquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become\nfamiliar with Canada.\n    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to\ncompete in the increasingly global securities market, industry\nofficials said.\n    \"That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change\nwill throw off one or two Canadian global firms,\" Toronto Stock\nExchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.\n    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed\ncautiously into the securities field.\n    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the\nbanks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will also\nfind it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culture\nwith that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,\nthey said.\n    While the banks have been approached by securities firms\nseeking merger partners, they have not yet bought into\nbrokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.\n    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest\nbank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.\nafter several months of negotiations.\n    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally\nacquires an existing firm, \"all the other banks will jump in.\n    \"They don't want to be perceived as missing out on\nsomething,\" said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analyst\nAlbert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensive\na risk for banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Land\nrights activists see no progress at all and say things are\nactually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures have\nforced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.\n    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debated\npolitical issues, is particularly to the fore this year as a\nConstituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.\n    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does\nnot give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landless\nfamilies, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.\n    \"We make no secret of our tactics,\" said one leader of the\nland reform movement, Joao Pedro. \"The solution is to occupy --\nthat is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been a\nsingle program of land reform in the world without the people\noccupying land.\"\n    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato\nGrosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,\naccording to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linked\nto the Roman Catholic Church.\n    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after the\ncivilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimed\nto resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up\nthe country's vast, undeveloped estates.\n    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,\ndescribed the program as \"one of its absolute priorities.\"\n    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped so\nfar and the government admits that it will not get anywhere\nnear the original target.\n    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was\nnow slower under Sarney than it had been under the military\ngovernment of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).\n    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep\nfrustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in\nSao Paulo and other parts of the country.\n    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, far\nfrom improving, have significantly deteriorated.\n    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,\nsaid that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers had\nbeen forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.\n    He said the exodus had been caused first by the\ngovernment's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year froze\nprices and hit the income of small farmers.\n    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices and\ninterest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay\ndebts taken out during the price freeze.\n    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left the\ncountryside in the south had previously been land-owners, while\na minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil's\nswollen cities.\n    One activist said the number of landless day labourers\ncalled \"boias-frias\" (literally \"cold meals\"), most of whom cut\nsugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state from\nabout 300,000 five years ago.\n    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, the\nland reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it\nis sending to the Constituent Assembly.\n    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum\npermissible holding and the land rights movement does not\nexpect it to be voted into the constitution.\n    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is\ncomposed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly would\nprobably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection\nwould be the signal for large-scale land invasions.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

{"title": "TEXACO (QTX) MAY BENEFIT FROM SEC BRIEF", "body": "The Securities and Exchange\nCommission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and\nPennzoil Co <PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion\ndlr legal saga, some analysts said.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would file a \"friend of the\ncourt\" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the\ncase. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since\nthey said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the\nrule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas\ncourts.\n    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four\nto 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the\nSEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request\nfor a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been\npreviously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC\nbrief but it did not know whether the brief would support the\nview of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for\nclarification of the reasons for two lower state court\ndecisions.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme\nCourt to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.\n    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a\ntender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an\nalleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.\n    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those\nmaking the offer from entering into contracts for the target\ncompany's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes\nSEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could\nalso have no affect. \"If this friend of the court brief is\npotent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the\nTexas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment\ncould be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing,\" Leuffer said.\n    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal\nbattle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court\nawarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later\nreduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now\ntotals 10.3 billion dlrs.\n    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal\nbankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to\navoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security\nbond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.\n    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of\nJuly 20.\n    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other\nanalysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a\nsignificant role. \"The other argument is the court will ignore\nit (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court\nbriefs,\" he said.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not\nexpect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.\n\"Everyday, you're going to see something like this,\" Cohen\nsaid.\n    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe\nthat the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it\nbelieved the 10b-13 rule was involved. \"I think what the market\nsensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that\nthey may reach for the stars and fall on their face,\" Sales\nsaid. \"They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas,\" said Joel\nFischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other\nanalysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal\nlaw that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or\nrefuses to hear its case.\n    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to\nthe 10b-13 issue.\n    Sales said the point was argued and the courts\n\"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the\nlegal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we\ncan correct that misimpression\".\n    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many\npossible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that\nTexaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded\nby Pennzoil.\n    \"The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae\n(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit\ndisturbed,\" said Cohen.\n    \"What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight\nmove down the road could have a multiplying effect,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the\nU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.\"\n    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which\ndragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the\nvery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation\nfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.\n    \"If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street\n...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,\" said\nGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from\nother London and Tokyo analysts.\n    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of\nfurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary\npressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.\n    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the\nequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.\n    \"It would be suicidal for any government in the context of\nwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up their\ninterest rates,\" he added.\n    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime\nlending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed\nchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial\nsystem.\n    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock\ncollapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking\ncrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.\n    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of\n1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said\ntoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and\nthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in\nmind.\n    \"The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.\nIf the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic\ngrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a\nmore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,\" said Capel's\nDennis.

He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be\nforced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnerships\nwith one another in the face of intense competition.\n     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stock\nprices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely\nhave \"a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies.\"\n    \"In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see it\nvery soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York is\nthe best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of of\nthe country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of car\nsales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest of\nthe country in the next six months,\" Perkins said.\n     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New\nYork Stock Exchange hurts the car market because \"it does\ncreate a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers.\"\n     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess\nthe impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy\nbefore making any changes in its basic business plan for the\nU.S. market.\n    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total at\nleast 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about\n630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000\ncars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.\n    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 cars\nfrom Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation under\nTokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.\n    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its\ncurrent allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car\nexport quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\nthe US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\nand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\nin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\nquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\n    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\nGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\nstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\nGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\n    \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\nlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\nwith Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.\n    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\nBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\nin the U.S., Aschoff said.\n    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\nbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\nthought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\n    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\nLtd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\nand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\nsecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\nbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"\n    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\nreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\nat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\n    Economists said the United States now appeared to have\nagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\nthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\n    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\nWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\ntold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\nout central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\non exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\n    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\nGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\nstability.

Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from\nimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the\nquota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500\ntonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will\nbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.\n    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of\n5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced\nlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.\n    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said\nthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their\nexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries.

That's not\nthe overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits.\"\n    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,\npointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when \"the Fed\nacted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money.\"\n   \n    Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,\ntold Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.\n    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.\nBoone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929\nsituation.\n    \"It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a\ncomparison is valid.\"\n    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the\nconservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present\nsafeguards will work.\n   \n    \"The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve\nof its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy,\" he\nsaid. \"There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread\ninto the real economy.

That doesn't show much\nunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"\n    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\ntoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\n    \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\nyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\nmarkets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of\nNikko Securities International in New York.\n    \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\nmaking him responsible for it was a little like killing the\nmessenger,\" he said.\n    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\nmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\nin Paris in February, was still in effect.\n    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\na prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\nthe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\nwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\n   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\nBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\nglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\nrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\n    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\nmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\nexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\nmarket for debtor country exports.\n    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\nthat the Republican party might face next year's presidential\nelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\ntarnished.\n    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\ncrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\nalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\n    \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\neconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\nquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\neventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"\nformer deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\ntelevision interview.\n    In many ways, the official response was mild.\n    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\nwith President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\nthat he was \"puzzled.\"\n    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\nreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\nand, presumably, their political impact.\n    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\nWashington will diminish because of the market fall.\n    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\nof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\nBentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to\nbe doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\nattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\nretire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do\nthat.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

If that is the case the Republicans will\nhave a very difficult time winning,\" independent political\nanalyst William Schneider told Reuters. \"If the Democrats\nnominate anyone halfway credible they would win,\" he added.\n    Schneider's comments, on the heels of a 500-point decline\nin the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average, reflected the\nold political adage that elections are almost always decided by\nvoters' feelings about their financial well being.\n    \"There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and\nwe don't expect 1988 to be any different,\" says Donald Foley,\nthe top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard\nGephardt's Democratic presidential campaign.\n    Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has\nshown amazing resilience and \"there's no telling where the\nmarket will be by the end of the week.\"\n    President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events,\nbut is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound.\n    \"I think everyone is puzzled ... because all the business\nindices are up.

Our economy has recovered to\nbe the strongest in history,\" Bush said in reference to the\nrecovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to\nits highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n    \"We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion\nin our nation's recorded history,\" Bush bragged.\n    At midday, even as Wall Street was being battered by a\nrecord selling panic, Reagan gave a glowing account of the\neconomy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new\nCommerce Secretary, William Verity.\n    Indeed, the Labor Department reported earlier this month\nthat unemployment among American workers had fallen to an\neight-year low of 5.9 pct in September, compared to seven pct a\nyear ago and a Post World War Two peak of 10.7 pct in December\n1982.\n    But with interest rates climbing steadily and no\nimprovement in the record U.S. trade deficit with the rest of\nthe world, a number of economic experts have expressed doubts\nabout the staying power of the current expansion.\n   Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a\nstaple of Democratic campaign speeches this year.\n    And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational\nmeeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy\nwould be the determining factor in next year's election.\n    \"The 1988 election will be decided, as most peacetime\nelections are, on economic issues,\" said Michigan party chairman\nRichard Weiner.\n    \"In Ohio, people are uneasy.

{"title": "U.S. STOCK DECLINE RENEWS DEBATE ABOUT FUTURES", "body": "Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since\n1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern\ninvestment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into\ncolossal moves in share prices.\n    \"The market has gotten away from the players,\" said Dudley\nEppel, vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin and\nJenrette Securities Corp. He says stock index futures and\noptions have distorted the investment process.\n    But Wall Street professionals who work with index futures\nand options insist the blame is misplaced.\n    Fischer Black, head of the trading and arbitrage division\nat Goldman, Sachs and Co, says so-called program trading\nstrategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock\nindices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for\ntoday's decline. \"People have changed their minds about the\nfuture of the economy,\" he said. Another strategy, known as\nportfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a small\ndegree, said Black.\n    Eli Wachtel of Bear, Stearns and Co was emphatic. \"I do not\nbelieve the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or\nexpanded by program trading.\"\n    \"The only thing that will stop it in the end is the value\ninvestor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers', and\nbuys for traditional reasons\" said Jeffrey Miller of Miller\nTabak Hirsch and Co.\n    IBM <IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage dropped more than 500 points.\n    Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first to\npursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in an\nautomatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the\nprices of the futures and the underlying stocks. But he said\nhis firm has not been involved in that since late last year.\n    Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent\nmarket declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio\ninsurance. He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds\nprior to the decline were hedged with futures.\n    The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investors\nat the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to\na future course of action such as buying a put option. While\nnegative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build\nfor months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow\nspan of time, because they are executed as the market starts to\nfall.\n    Miller said at present people can only guess how much\nportfolio insurance is in use. He suggested some system of\ndisclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds\nwere being planted that might add to a future decline.\n    But in any case Miller argued that index futures and\noptions do not initiate market trends.\n    People like Eppel of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette were\nsteadfast in their criticism. \"If I had my way there wouldn't\nbe any index futures,\" he said. \"They propelled the market up\nwhen nothing was going on and now we're paying the price.\"\n    Another irate trader, referring to IBM's 31 point drop,\ncomplained \"what announcement did IBM make over the weekend\nthat made its stock drop 31 points?\" IBM was as high as 175-7/8\nearlier this year.\n    Some economists agreed that the stock market could be\nsending signals about the economy.  Allen Sinai, chief\neconomist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, told Reuters the 508\npoint decline represented \"a crisis of confidence.\n    \"This is a a bona-fide financial crisis. The market is\nshowing panic. I suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our\nmarkets by a lot of foreign investors.\"\n    Sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing U.S. budget\nand trade deficits and by rising interest rates. \"This is not a\nsignal of the start of a recession, but a strong indicator that\none is coming if nothing is done in Washington to deal with the\nbudget and trade deficits,\" Sinai said.\n    Some market participants said redemptions by investors who\nown mutual funds fueled the decline. But Steve Norwitz, a\nspokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, a Baltimore-based\ninvestment management firm, said redemptions and switches into\nmoney market funds by Price's one mln accounts amounted to less\nthan two pct of assets. \"It's not a rout by any means.\"\n   \n    Norwitz said the company normally receives about 3,500\ntelephone inquiries from its customers each day. On Friday, he\nsaid, when the Dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls\nrose to around 7,000 and today it exceeded that although he did\nnot have a precise number.\n    Ike Kerridge, an economist with the oilfield service firm\nBaker Hughes Inc., was one of several analysts who said the\nevaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alter\nconsumer behavior.\n    \"This could be the trigger for a national recession which\nwould be very unusual in an election year,\" Kerridge said.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}
{"title": "BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS", "body": "News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the\ndollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.\n    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great\nsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by\nBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears\nthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.\n    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two\npfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.\n    The announcement of the meeting, also attended by\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously\nin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York\nmarkets.\n    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies\naccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry\nspokesman in Bonn said.\n    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of\n1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\nreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\nrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\nWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\ncoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\nthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\ntheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\ndeficit.\n    West German government sources said rising West German\nmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\npact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\nrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\nsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\nraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n    German yields have also risen over this period, but less\nmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\nshort-term rates by changing the terms on its security\nrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\nmoney market.\n    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\ncompared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\ninability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\nbut also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\nBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\ngrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\nbank economists said.\n    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\npragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\nsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\nmore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\nthe Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\nmorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\nanger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n    \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\nunder American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\nSwiss Bank Corp here.\n    \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\nsignificant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\neconomist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\nthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\non Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\neconomists said.\n    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\ndoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\nrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\nlittle changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\nthat the meeting would take place, although the Finance\nMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\ncomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\naccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\nassumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\nGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit\nDenmark and Belgium.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

Those procedures\ninclude checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin\npositions, and backlog. \"We know of no firm that has a\nsignificant problem, but that could change at any moment,\" he\nsaid.\n    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, \"We\ndo not know where the market will end up.\"\n    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508\npoints to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,\nalmost double the previous record.\n    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign\nmarkets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the\nglobal economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of\nthe U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings\nalso continue to be firm.\n    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result\nof a confluence of factors, including the globalization of\nmarkets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.\n    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,\nhe said.\n    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact\nthat there has been no major correction in the five-year bull\nmarket. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.\n    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in\nall trading on the exchange, Phelan said. \"The consensus was\nthat it is better to let the market try to work itself out,\" he\nsaid.\n    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of\ntrading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said\nhe was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and\nthe Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter\nof routine.\n Reuter\n\u0003"}

He was\nreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group\nof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the\npact.\n    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both\nhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic\ngrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.\nAgreed to stop talking the dollar down.\n    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre\nagreement was still operative, the West German interest rate\nmove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.\n    \"The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that\nhe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets\nare off in terms of currency cooperation,\" Chris Johns, currency\nanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.\n    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine\nview, telling Reuters that \"the exchange market is apparently\nreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker\ncomment will regret it later on.\"\n    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the\nLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to\nrespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for \"a faithful\nand firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the\nLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.\"\n    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British\nTreasury commented on the row.\n    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite\nU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, \"this does\nnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the\nLouvre Accord.\"\n    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive\nof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that\nfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.\nWas still committed to the accord.\n    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible\ngesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term\nliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on\nMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected\nmedium-term liquidity last week.

We will not see new\nissuance dry up either.\"\n    Still, the pace of corporate borrowing in the public\nfinance market has slowed, according to a Reuter tabulation.\n    Last week, which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday,\nsaw issuance of 1.3 billion dlrs of new debt. That was down\nfrom the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion\ndlrs of new debt.\n    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those\namounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took\nadvantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance\nold, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at\nlow, attractive rates, underwriters noted.\n    \"Companies will conduct financings that they believe are\nessential,\" said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street\nfirm. \"But we will not see much more than that until the market\nstabilizes.\"\n    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter\nterm issues, analysts said. For instance, of last week's nine\nissues, only one had a maturity of more than 10 years.\n    The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years,\nwith most clustered in the two to three year area, according to\na Reuter tabulation. That is because single-digit interest\nrates were had last week only among two-year securities.\n    \"If people think that interest rates will continue to head\nhigher, then we could see treasurers rushing to market,\" said a\ntrader with a medium-sized securities house.\n    \"But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise\nis a fluke, treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to\ndecline before issuing new debt, hoping of course that they are\nnot missing the boat by doing so,\" she added.\n    Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm\nreception to new issues by institutional and retail investors\nin recent weeks, traders pointed out. Many investors refrained\nfrom buying because they believed rate would rise further.\n    \"We saw a lot of buying interest last week, but people are\nnot yet willing to pull the trigger,\" a broker said. \"They\nwould rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be\nsustained.\"\n    Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest\nrates did not help, analysts said. For instance, Henry Kaufman,\nchief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc, said in his weekly\n\"Comments on Credit\" that the yields of U.S. Treasury bonds\nwould probably rise further because the marketplace expects\ninflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline.\n    In contrast, Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that\nprices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would\nrecover.

This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\npublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary\npolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise\ncurrencies was still working, but added: \"On the other hand, we\nwill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest\nrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United\nStates will raise rates.\"\n    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in\nZurich said: \"The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the\nU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.\"\n    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's\nfinancial research department, called the sell-off \"overdone,\"\nbut warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks\nloosen their monetary policy.\n    \"I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,\" he\nsaid. \"The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in\nwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an\neconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.\"\n    Wyttenbach said the \"Black Monday\" sell-off was clearly\nexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation\ncertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.\n    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction\nwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors\nonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be\nanother, smaller selling wave.\n    \"As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --\nthen we'll get a strong movement upward,\" Wyttenbach said. But\nthat may not come soon.\n    \"People are simply worried that in America, where the market\nhas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,\"\nhe said. \"People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.\"\n    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current\nproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. \"We do not have a\nmark problem, we have a dollar problem,\" he added, but said the\nbiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal\nReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.\n    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the\ndollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest\nrates might have to rise. \"As a central banker he shouldn't do\nthat,\" Wyttenbach said. \"There is a danger that we will fall back\ninto the 1970s,\" he said. \"We have a real crisis of confidence in\nGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.\"\n    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.\n    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: \"I'm relatively optimistic\nbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to\nintervene.\"\n    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take\nany significant steps, adding that the focus of attention\nremains on the United States.\n    \"The panic started in New York, it has to end there.\"\n    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting\nthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before\ndeciding what to do.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

October shipments were back to\ncontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from\nother ports.\n    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude\nrather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG\nsupply disruptions, traders said.\n    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was\nunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.\n    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly\nrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a\nmoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.\n    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift\nslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from\nIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.\n    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in\nlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian\nLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the\nyear ended March 1987, the sources said.\n    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down\nterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on\nthe spot market, they said.\n    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which\n5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term\ncontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of\nJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.\n    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made\nsome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the\nrecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the\nJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.\n    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been\nunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to\nreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.\n    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by\nPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87\npct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)\nof Arabian Light.\n    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings\nshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian\nLight's GSP.\n    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the\n95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,\nthe trade sources said.\n    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying\nup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to\nseller-buyer agreement.\n    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut\nsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.\n    \"If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable\nbasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,\" said\nan official at a major importer. \"Freight costs are higher for\ncargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a\nlonger haul and war risk insurance payments.\"\n    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to\nfinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on\ncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar to\ncurrent levels, the sources said. \"When we talk business, we\nwould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of\nhigh dependence on a single supplier,\" said one.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION", "body": "Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's\ncentral bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are\nnormally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the\ncentral bank's independence.\n    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,\npresident of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a\ncontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of\nthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.\n    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last\nThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and\ninterest rates\n    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's\ncriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place\nfor foreign investors.\n    \"The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and\nFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign\ninvestors,\" said one economist for a London broker, who asked\nnot to be identified.\n    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial\npolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to\nsteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.\n    \"There are plenty of objective pressures which will result\nin things getting back to normal again after a period of ill\nfeeling,\" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.\n    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct\nwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in\na market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and\nabroad.\n    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the\nfinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the\nBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting\ndetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.\n    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under\nextraordinary pressures lately.\n    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his\ndeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight\ninflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had\npursued so far this year to promote currency stability.\n    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like\nSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been\nwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\ngrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\ncouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\nviews, bankers said.\n    \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\nPfister.\n    \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\nentirely his own,\" said another economist.\n    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\nthey will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\nand hurting West German exporters.\n    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\nBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\nBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\nwar of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\nOfficials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\nstimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\nof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\nStoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\nmost popular government politician last year, had to face\nresistance from local barons in the government coalition\nparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n4.3 billion marks.\n    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\npush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\ngovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\nwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\nmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\nSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\nallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\nlosses for the CDU in state elections.\n    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\nweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\nremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\nwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\nyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\ngave Poehl another eight-year term.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\nhoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\nnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\nBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

{"title": "COMPETITION TOUGHENS FOR NEAR-SUPERCOMPUTERS", "body": "An announcement by Alliant Computer\nSystems Inc <ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and <ETA\nSystems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the same\ncategory show competition is stiff in this market, industry\nanalysts said.\n     Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer, aimed mainly\nat scientists and researchers will be priced between 100,000\nand 200,000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that\nprice range. But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in\nline with discounts it now gives many of its customers.\n    \"(The new FX) is significant to the extent that it\nrepresents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the\nmarketplace,\" said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the\nnew computer. \"The list price is more in line with what they are\nseeing anyway.\"\n    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,\nresemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but\nare much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.\n    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but\nmini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrs\nand one mln dlrs.\n    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture\ncalled parallel processing, in which a problem is broken up\ninto segments and each segment assigned to a different\nprocessor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just one\nprocessor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,\nmaking them too slow for complex scientific problems.\n    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about\nfive years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant and\nConvex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successful\ninitial public offerings last year.\n    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facing\nsome 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in\nsales this year, and the result has been lower prices and\nshrinking profit margins.\n    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientific\nmarket, lack of software and too many competitors also have\nmade analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.\n    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,\nsaid he just added a year to his original growth estimates for\nthe industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in\n1991, instead of 1990.\n    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their\nthird quarter earnings would be reduced by \"competitive pricing\npressures.\"\n    Alliant said profits for the period will be about five\ncents a share against eight cents last year, although revenues\nfor the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.\n    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the\nsecond quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise\nalmost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18\nand 18.5 mln dlrs.\n    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at the\nbottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETA\nSystem's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant\nfrom the top, analysts said.\n    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp <CDC>, introduced\ntwo machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar\nto those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggest\nsupercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapest\nmodel. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is\n1.2 mln dlrs.\n    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may\nbe classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at\nthe upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.\n    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of\nsoftware, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces all\nparallel processor makers to some degree.\n    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has\nyet to be widely used, third party software vendors have been\nslow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.\n    ETA, however, \"offers a low priced entry into supercomputers\nfor some customers,\" one consultant said.\n    Canin cautioned that \"the price pressures will continue for\nsome time\" and estimated that five percentage points have been\nknocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant\nthis year by price discounting.\n    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new set\nof problems as they both introduce their second generation of\nproducts. \"I am always cautious about the first major product\ntransition.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003"}

If the\ncurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,\"\nsaid Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi\nKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.\n    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday\ncloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.\n    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of\n140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York\nand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.\n    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.\nTreasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.\n    \"The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish\nsentiment after Baker's comments,\" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He\nsaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among\nthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the\nLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.\n    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day\ndrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness\nin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.\n    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he\nstrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest\nrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience\nwith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord\ndue to their fears of increasing inflation.\n    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary\npressures also slow domestic demand.\n    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to\nboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade\ndeficit, Tanaka said.\n    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still\nmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest\nrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.\n    \"Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations\ncoordinate dollar buying intervention,\" said Soichi Hirabayashi,\ndeputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange\ndepartment.\n    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally\nconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.\n    \"The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near\nfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations\nfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre\naccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,\"\nHirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low\nas 135 yen soon.\n REUTER\n\u0003"}
